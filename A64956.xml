            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Agitur de Magnis:</hi> Things of the greateſt Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are here treated of. The ſubject matter of this Diſcourſe is its Commendation: Mans Converſion to God is explain'd and preſs'd.

The <hi>Pruritus Diſputandi,</hi> the Itch of Diſputing has taken away the Beauty of the <hi>Churches Face</hi> and <hi>Hands:</hi> Certainly it would be more for the Churches Health and Strength and Glory, if the great Truths of the Goſpel were more inſiſted on; namely, <hi>Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> which is the ſame with <hi>Repentance towards God.</hi>

Among the other Works of God, the Pſalmiſt takes ſpecial notice of the <hi>Sun in the Firmament,</hi> whoſe light and influence is ſo great and beneficial; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106042:7"/> then makes a tranſition to the Law and Word of God, whoſe <hi>Light</hi> in a ſenſe <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures</hi> that <hi>glorious Luminary;</hi> giving ſuch a clear manifeſtation, and affecting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Man, concerning his Maker, as turns his Heart to him, though natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind and fooliſh, alienated and eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Him. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, Converting the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This weighty Argument of <hi>Converſion,</hi> I begin to inſiſt on this day. <hi>Converſion to God</hi> is the <hi>Epitome of Religion,</hi> it is the <hi>Summe of Law and Goſpel;</hi> in a <hi>few Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables,</hi> it is fallen Man's recovery and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again, and the new making of that which Sin had marr'd and ſpoyled; it is the ſhutting of Hell, and is exceedingly oppoſed by the evil Angels that are there; it is the opening of the gate of Heaven: There is <hi>no Flaming Sword</hi> to keep the true Convert <hi>from the Tree of Life;</hi> he ſhall have entrance into the Paradiſe of God, and be crown'd with Righteouſneſs and Immortality.</p>
                  <p>But is not the <hi>Tongue of an Angel</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be employed in calling to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than that of a mortal Man? Is there not need of the loudeſt Thunder, or ſuch an amazing ſound as was heard when the <hi>Law</hi> was delivered on <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> of old?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106042:7"/> How unlikely, alas! how unlikely are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane endeavours to be ſucceſsful! ſince where Converſion is, the <hi>Power of Satan</hi> muſt be vanquiſht; the <hi>Dominion of Sin,</hi> unto which the whole World almoſt is ſubject, muſt be <hi>thrown down;</hi> the <hi>Deaf</hi> muſt be made to <hi>hear,</hi> the <hi>Blind</hi> muſt be made to <hi>ſee,</hi> and the <hi>Dead</hi> muſt be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>higheſt Life</hi> in this World, and that is <hi>Life Spiritual;</hi> and <hi>Nature it ſelf</hi> muſt be changed, and of <hi>Old</hi> become <hi>New.</hi> Lord! what is Man, that he ſhould be employed in ſuch a work as this! the <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Veſſel</hi> is <hi>weak,</hi> or rather <hi>nothing;</hi> the <hi>Treaſure</hi> is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of its <hi>Power</hi> is of the <hi>Lord himſelf. The Law of Lord is perfect, Converting the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Text there are four things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable.</p>
                  <p>1. The Word of God is called the <hi>Law of the Lord.</hi> The Law comprehends not only the Preceptive part, but alſo the whole Doctrine revealed in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. The very Goſpel it ſelf is ſtyled the <hi>Law of Faith:</hi> Well may the Word of God be called a <hi>Law,</hi> ſince its Author is the <hi>great Law-giver, who has Power to ſave and to deſtroy;</hi> and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deep Obligation it layes Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106042:8"/> A <hi>principal part</hi> of the Word, are the <hi>Commands</hi> of it; the <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> are <hi>Appendices</hi> to the <hi>Precepts;</hi> and the <hi>Examples,</hi> in which both Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Threatnings are in ſome meaſure fulfilled, may ſtrongly excite unto Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>2. Here is an excellent Property of this Word of God, 'tis <hi>Perfect;</hi> though ſome moſt impiouſly make bold with it, and eke it out with their own <hi>Traditions,</hi> which they make to be of equal Authority with it; yet the Word of God is perfect, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient as <hi>a Means</hi> to attain the <hi>End</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto 'tis deſigned, turning Sinners to God, and making them wiſe unto Salvation. He does moſt truly conſult his own Eternal Peace and Safety, and is indeed the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Man, who refuſes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to <hi>be wiſe above what is written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Here is a notable Effect of the Word of God, and that is <hi>Converſion:</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew has it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>redire faciens,</hi> making to return; ſome Interpreters referr this to the <hi>reſtoring and comforting Power</hi> of the Word of God; which brings as it were, the Man to life again, who was ready to dye away, and to ſink under the burthen of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery But this <hi>Conſolation ſuppoſes</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106042:8"/> and Repentance; and it ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that the Pſalmiſt enumerating the more remarkable effects of the Word of God, ſhould omit this of Converſion, which is one of the chiefeſt among them all.</p>
                  <p>4. The <hi>Sincerity of Converſion</hi> is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the <hi>Soul</hi> is ſaid to be Converted. The Soul is ſometimes taken for the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> for the whole Man: The whole Man is by Sin corrupted and depraved, and ſtrongly inclined to depart from God; there is need that the whole ſhould be renewed and reduced. Sometimes the Soul is taken for the <hi>ſpiritual and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of Man;</hi> and when <hi>this</hi> is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and inclined, and turned to God, then the <hi>very Heart</hi> which he ſo often calls for, is given him, and the Change that is wrought, is inward, real, ſaving.</p>
                  <p>I raiſe <hi>four Doctrines</hi> from the Text.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Converſion to God is of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the great thing he requires of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Converſion to God is then ſincere, when the Soul is Converted to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Word of God is the great Means of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>In the Word of God, which is the Means of Converſion, there is a Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Sufficiency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106042:9"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> I. I begin with the firſt of theſe. <hi>Converſion. to God is of abſolute neceſſity, and the great thing he requires of Man:</hi> 'Tis ſpoken of in the Text, as that which is Man's Duty, Man's Benefit, and that which is inexpreſſibly for Mans Intereſt. <hi>Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Soul, is really <hi>Saving</hi> it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Converſion there can be no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He that turns from his evil wayes ſhall live; he that is reſolved againſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is in effect reſolved to ruine himſelf; Death he <hi>wills,</hi> Death he <hi>chuſes,</hi> and 'tis a ſtrange choice that the Will makes, <hi>Ezek. 33. 11. As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked ſhould turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil wayes, for why will you dye, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Speak of the preparative Antecedents of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Explain the Nature of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Tell you <hi>what are the Properties of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Demonſtrate <hi>the neceſſity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and the reaſon why God does ſo much require it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Anſwer the Arguments which the carnal minds of Men object againſt Converſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106042:11"/> the body of Sin may be more and more deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>4. In Converſion there is a <hi>turning from the power of Satan.</hi> Unconverted ones <hi>are of their Father the Devil, and the luſts of their Father they will do;</hi> but Converts are no longer at his beck, they are <hi>not led Captive by him at his will,</hi> but are recovered out of his Snare. Satans great Work and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, is to tempt the Children of men to ſin; he is unalterably confirmed and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in wickedneſs himſelf, and with might and main he ſtrives to propagate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the World: He is ſtyled <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>Tempter,</hi> and the <hi>evil One;</hi> he is ever ſoliciting and perſwading men to what is evil, and truly he prevails, and works his will and their woe in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience; but Converts reſiſt him by the Word and Prayer, and uſing both in Faith, they <hi>put on the whole armour of God, and ſtand againſt the waies of the Devil,</hi> Eph. 6. 11.</p>
                  <p>5. In Converſion there is <hi>an alteration of corrupt Nature it ſelf, and its corrupt and vitious Inclination:</hi> This the Apoſtle calls <hi>puting off the old Man which is corrupt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful luſts,</hi> Eph. 4. 22. The old byaſs that ſo ſtrongly inclined the Heart towards Sin, the World, and Hell,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106042:12"/> is taken away; habits of ſin are left, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in evil ceaſes, and Nature is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the heart by a work of new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made after the Heart of God, and that which before Converſion was the <hi>worſt part</hi> of Man, <hi>being deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked,</hi> now becomes the <hi>beſt</hi> part of all, and is ſtill deſiring that it ſelf and the whole Man were more compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſed from Sin, and ſanctified. I have told you what Converſion is with reference to Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Converſion may be conſidered with reference to <hi>this preſent World:</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Converſion is true, as there is a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leaving of Sin, ſo there is a <hi>wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from this preſent World. In the Word of God we have the trueſt Map of this World; it is ſet forth as a far Countrey, far from Heaven, bordering upon Hell, and Satan is the Deity that generally here is ſerved, who is therefore called <hi>the God of this World,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. It is full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſnares, the grand Idol that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Lord to jealouſie; 'tis that which ſtands in competition with Chriſt, and by moſt Hearts is preferr'd before him; 'tis the Devils moſt taking bait, wherewith he beguiles and ruins immortal Souls.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106042:12"/> Chriſt both <hi>Prayed</hi> and <hi>Dyed,</hi> that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers might be delivered from it: He Prayed, <hi>Joh. 17. 15. I Pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the World, but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi> He Died to this end alſo, <hi>Gal. 1. 4. Who gave himſelf for our Sins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World, according to the will of God and our Father:</hi> Converts therefore look not upon this World, and they have good reaſon not to look upon it as ſo deſirable a thing. Converſion lies much in <hi>keeping our ſelves unſpotted from the VVorld,</hi> and in <hi>denying worldly luſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires,</hi> Jam. 1. 27. Tit. 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>1. The Convert has <hi>no friendſhip with the VVorld,</hi> becauſe the <hi>friendſhip of the VVorld is Enmity with God,</hi> Jam. 4. 4. He values not the Worlds Favour above Gods, he fears not the Worlds Diſpleaſure more than the Lords Anger; he prizes the Love of God and the light of his Countenance, above all the reſpects and ſmiles of Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: And if he has but a comfortable aſſurance that the Lord is at Peace, he does not ſo much care though all the World fall out with him. Indeed in a <hi>ſenſe,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert is a <hi>true Friend</hi> to the World; he Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Prayes for the World, and the World is ſpared for the Saints ſake that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106042:13"/> 
                     <hi>are in it,</hi> and <hi>are to be born into it.</hi> A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is condemned to dye, if ſhe be with Child, ſhe is ſpared till delivered: In this World <hi>many are to be born</hi> that <hi>will be born again,</hi> and hence it is that the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>VVorlds burning</hi> is not yet <hi>Executed.</hi> But in the Apoſtles ſenſe the Convert ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be the Worlds friend; he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious though the World be never ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, he will look towards Heaven, he will <hi>look at the things unſeen, which are eternal,</hi> though the World never give him a good look more.</p>
                  <p>2. The Convert is not <hi>conformed to this VVorld.</hi> Conformity in this ſenſe is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing, and inconſiſtent with Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; how plain is the Apoſtles Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. And be not conformed to this VVorld, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds, that ye may prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God.</hi> The Conformiſt to this World minds not the Will of God, nor what is good and acceptable to Him: He that is truly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted is otherwiſe minded, he diſlikes the manners, and <hi>eſcapes the pollutions of the VVorld; he runs not out with others to the ſame exceſs of riot,</hi> he dares not follow a multitude to do evil, becauſe deſtruction and miſery are in their wayes; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106042:13"/> as the Apoſtle directs, <hi>He lives the reſt of his time in the fleſh, not to the luſts of men, but to the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 2.</p>
                  <p>3. The Convert is not a <hi>Lover and Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the VVorld, as if it were the beſt Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion:</hi> He is made ſeriouſly to take notice of the <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit</hi> that is found in the enjoyment of the World, and how ſhort a time at longeſt 'tis to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; he concludes, 'twere better never to have been <hi>a Man,</hi> than to be only <hi>a Man of the VVorld,</hi> better never to have <hi>lived,</hi> than to be put off <hi>with a Portion here in this life,</hi> Pſal. 17, 14. Better never to have had a Soul, than to <hi>diſappoint</hi> it with the things of the World, which are unſuitable to its nature, and inſuſticient for its ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to <hi>loſe it</hi> for the gaining of ſuch poor things as theſe. <hi>Contempt of this VVorld</hi> is always an ingredient in ſincere Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the higheſt Profeſſion, the moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Language, argues but the greater Hypocriſie, if the Heart be earthly: Thoſe Hearts that chiefly mind earthly things, ſhould meditate Terrour when they read 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 15. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Convert is <hi>no longer acted by the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106042:14"/> ſpirit of this VVorld:</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 12. <hi>Now we have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God:</hi> And how infinitely more excellent, deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and durable, are the things which are freely given of God in the Goſpel, than all things which the World can boaſt of? The ſpirit of the World, is the <hi>genius, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition of the World;</hi> ſuch a Mind, ſuch a Will; ſuch Affections as the Men of the World have. The Convert ſees not with the Worlds eyes, judges not as the World judges, but diſcerns between things that differ, and approves the things that are moſt excellent; his enlightned and rectified Judgment weighs the things of the World in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and he writes <hi>Tekel</hi> upon them all, becauſe being <hi>weighed they are found wanting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The Convert <hi>uſes this World as not abuſing it:</hi> He calls himſelf bruitiſh becauſe of his former affecting it, becauſe it made him ſuch a <hi>Fool,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Slave;</hi> but now he recovers his Dominion over the Creatures which was loſt by the fall: Earth is now <hi>under foot,</hi> which is its <hi>proper place,</hi> and the things of it he improves for God. He lives as a Stranger and Pilgrim, and he puts the <hi>Mammon of unrighteouſneſs</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106042:14"/> and gracious uſes, and doing good with the World, he ſcapes the evil of it, and becomes more and more meet for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>And are Converts thus indeed turn'd from Sin? do they thus come out from the World? Lord! how few will be ſaved! for how ſmall is the number of thoſe who are thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted! You ſee what Converſion is with reference to the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Converſion may be conſidered with reference to the <hi>Sinner himſelf,</hi> and ſo it includes that great Chriſtian Duty of <hi>Self-denyal.</hi> What a ſtrange Creature has Sin turn'd Man into! that he muſt <hi>beware of himſelf, eſpecially</hi> as one that is <hi>falſe, and a Foe to himſelf;</hi> he is to flye from <hi>Sin,</hi> he is to reſiſt <hi>Satan,</hi> and from <hi>Self</hi> how unconceivable is his danger! Where ſhall Man find his greateſt Enemy? not among his moſt malicious Neighbours, not among the evil Angels, though theſe as ſo many <hi>roaring Lions, go about ſeeking whom they may devour;</hi> but Man muſt look into his own Breaſt, and ranſack his own Heart, and there he will find the moſt deadly Foe; his Deſtruction is of <hi>himſelf,</hi> he <hi>procures evil to himſelf,</hi> Jer. 2. 17. <hi>He treaſures up unto</hi> himſelf Wrath <hi>againſt the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106042:15"/> day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. Our Lord very well knew how pernicious and fooliſh Mans <hi>own Counſels</hi> are, how hurtful his <hi>own Luſts and Inclinations,</hi> therefore he preſſes Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal upon all his followers, <hi>Luk. 9. 23. He ſaid unto them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily and follow me:</hi> The true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert does thus, for he apprehends what a <hi>Party</hi> there is <hi>within</hi> him, that is indeed <hi>againſt</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>1. He that is Converted, <hi>mortifies Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love:</hi> The Apoſtle makes it a great part of the Sin, and a great reaſon of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillouſneſs of the latter dayes, that <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2. There is an <hi>holy Self-love,</hi> which is a Love to the Soul, and that's a Duty; and in this ſenſe only true Saints are true <hi>Self-lovers,</hi> and God loves them not the <hi>leſs,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> for being ſo. There is a <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Self-love,</hi> when the Fleſh is loved and gratified, when the Fleſh is the <hi>pondus,</hi> weight that ſets all wheels a going, when the Fleſh is the center in which all lines meet: This Self-love excludes the Love of <hi>God,</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and of the <hi>Brother,</hi> and is a great and fruitful root from whence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other Sins do grow. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts mortifie this Love of their Fleſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106042:15"/> they have Souls that deſerve and need their Love and Care, and whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ought mainly to be minded.</p>
                  <p>2. He that is Converted is <hi>not a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatterer.</hi> The wicked man <hi>flatters himſelf in his own eyes,</hi> until the Puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him proves his <hi>Iniquity is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in the eyes of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 2. He loves thoſe that flatter him, he ſayes to the <hi>Seers, ſee not, to the Prophets, propheſie not unto me right things, propheſie unto me ſmooth things,</hi> though you <hi>propheſie Deceits.</hi> The Convert is truly willing to know himſelf, and the worſt of himſelf, he can't endure Dawbers, the Word that ſearches moſt is moſt acceptable. He <hi>comes to the Light,</hi> that what is good in him may be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that God who has wrought that good may have the Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21. and that all remaining evil may be manifeſt, that it may be mortified.</p>
                  <p>3. He that is Converted is <hi>not a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſer:</hi> To be all for pleaſing his external ſenſes he accounts <hi>bruitiſh,</hi> to pleaſe his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he eſteems <hi>below reaſon,</hi> and <hi>contrary to Grace;</hi> and that 'tis the higheſt madneſs, for the ſake of ſinful and ſenſual Pleaſures, to incurr the Diſpleaſure and Indignation of the Almighty, and venture the enduring of eternal Vengeance. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106042:16"/> truth of his Converſion, in undervaluing the <hi>Pleaſures of Sin that were but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. He contemn'd the Delight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, the Honour of <hi>being the Son of</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Daughter,</hi> and <hi>choſe Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the People of God,</hi> that he might find a truer, an higher, a better Delight in God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>4. He that is Converted is <hi>not a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeker:</hi> He is not taken as once he was, with ſecular honour, and temporal gain, ſuch things ſway not with him, when the Honour of God and his own Salvation lye at ſtake. In different reſpects he is the <hi>greatest</hi> Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeker and the <hi>leaſt:</hi> No man minds his trueſt Intereſt, durable Riches, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory, but himſelf, and ſuch as are like-minded; and yet he can bear the ſcorn of Men, and the <hi>ſpoyling of his Goods,</hi> and if <hi>Chriſt be but magnified,</hi> he can lye in the duſt contentedly: He ſeeks not great things for himſelf on Earth; the Praiſe of Men he looks upon as empty and dangerous breath, without Gods approbation, and the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole World nothing, if God be not reconciled and enjoyed. How far were the Apoſtles from being Self-ſeekers, when that they might make Chriſt known in the World, and perſwade the World to receive him and be ſaved by him, they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106042:16"/> were contented to be made a <hi>ſpectacle to Angels and Men, to be hungry, thirſty, naked, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that places his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in himſelf, plainly diſcovers great <hi>Ignorance of himſelf,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the Goſpel,</hi> which is, that his <hi>Grace in Christ</hi> may be <hi>All,</hi> and that <hi>no Fleſh may glory</hi> in the Lords Preſence.</p>
                  <p>6. He that is Converted, is <hi>engaged in a Combat with himſelf;</hi> his Heart is a Field, where many a Battel is fought between him and his proud Self, between him and his luſtful Self, between him and his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Self, between him and his unbelieving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106042:17"/> Self. 'Tis eaſier to reſiſt the very Prince of the Devils, and to withſtand the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ſolicitations of Satans Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but for a Man to be at defiance with himſelf, to be continually almoſt chiding, loathing, croſſing and oppoſing himſelf, <hi>in this</hi> lies the moſt difficult part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian warfare. Within the Converts <hi>own Breaſt</hi> is the very <hi>heat of the Battel;</hi> Oh what ſtriving is there againſt <hi>Self-exalting Imaginations!</hi> what ſtruggling againſt <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh affections and deſigns!</hi> And with good reaſon is Self thus oppoſed by the Convert, ſince Self does ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Converts Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>turning</hi> be thus <hi>Self-denying,</hi> the prevalency of carnal Intereſt, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Self among Profeſſors of Religion, proves that though they are externally Called, yet there are few ſincere Converts among them: How <hi>tender</hi> are they in point of <hi>Gain,</hi> and <hi>Honour, and Reputation!</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon and thing that <hi>here</hi> ſtands in their way is a great <hi>eye-ſore: Religion</hi> ſhall <hi>ſtoop</hi> to worldly <hi>Intereſt, this</hi> ſhall be ſecured, though <hi>Faith and Conſcience</hi> be caſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.

In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his Grace:</hi> Indeed the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>one</hi> Sin that is <hi>unpardonable,</hi> that <hi>againſt the Holy Ghost;</hi> but the reaſon is not, as if it were <hi>too great</hi> for the Blood of Chriſt to procure the Pardon of it; but becauſe ſuch Sinners <hi>reſiſt and do deſpight to the Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, and will by no means be brought to him, but <hi>trample under foot the Son of God, and count his Blood an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and common thing.</hi> The Remedy is <hi>not inſufficient</hi> for them, but they perverſely <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,</hi> and will by <hi>no means uſe it,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore periſh.</p>
                  <p>2. The Convert is <hi>encouraged by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſerious, frequent, gracious invitations made in the Goſpel:</hi> All <hi>Offenders</hi> are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt who is Sinners <hi>Peace,</hi> for the <hi>Chaſtiſement of their peace was upon him,</hi> Iſa. 53. 5.

Whatever the guilt of Sin is, whatever the pollutions are, the Blood, the Spirit of Chriſt are offer'd in the Goſpel, and are ſufficient for the juſtifying and waſhing of the guilty and defiled.</p>
                  <p>3. The Convert <hi>receives Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes upon him for Pardon, Grace, and Life eternal:</hi> He is troubled that he received him no ſooner, that his Heart was with a fooliſh Obſtinacy ſhut againſt him for ſo long a time, though <hi>to receive him, is to have power to become a Son of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. But now his Heart is open to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Lord of life, this Prince and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Peace; his accepting Chriſt is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, a glad, a thankful acceptance; and in <hi>Him,</hi> not in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> he places his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and hopes; he deſpairs in himſelf, and every thing elſe, but he abounds in hope, becauſe of that <hi>ſuperabundant Grace</hi> that <hi>reigns by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5. 20, 21. And becauſe the Apoſtle plainly ſayes, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but deliver'd him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8. 32. The Converts eye is fixt on Jeſus at his very firſt Converſion, and ſtill he is <hi>looking to him,</hi> to his very diſſolution; he ſees in Him

                     <hi>Sixthly</hi> and Laſtly, Converſion may be conſidered with reference <hi>to the Word of God:</hi> This Word is the way into which every true Convert turns, <hi>Pſal. 119. 59, 60. I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet

The Converts <hi>natural enmity againſt the Word of God is cured;</hi> he neither with the <hi>Jews</hi> counts the Goſpel a <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> and matter of offence, nor with the <hi>Greeks</hi> does he eſteem it <hi>fooliſhneſs;</hi> he does not look upon the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the Word as <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,</hi> nor upon the <hi>ſtricteſt Rules</hi> as <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable:</hi> He owns the <hi>Authority</hi> of God in his Word, and acknowledges his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> in giving ſuch a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of his Will upon <hi>record,</hi> as is ſo <hi>faithful and worthy of all acceptation.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106042:28"/> truth, does not thus <hi>capitulate</hi> with God.</p>
                  <p>Such and ſuch ſins I will caſt away, but <hi>ſome</hi> I reſolve to <hi>keep</hi> and live in ſtill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my <hi>Conſtitution</hi> ſtrongly inclines me to them, becauſe I have <hi>much Wealth</hi> by them, and take <hi>much Pleaſure</hi> in them; ſuch and ſuch Commands I will obſerve, but <hi>ſome Precepts</hi> are <hi>too ſtrict</hi> for me, and theſe I will caſt behind my back: I am willing to ſuffer <hi>a little</hi> for Chriſt, ſome reproach, ſome loſs I am content to undergo, but I muſt be excuſed from Obedience, when I am called to <hi>loſe all</hi> that I have in the World, and <hi>my Life</hi> too; Commands thus to ſuffer are hard ſayings, who can hear them?</p>
                  <p>Theſe reſerves argue reigning and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hypocriſie. The ſound Convert is perſwaded that God requires no more but what is <hi>juſt and equal,</hi> and really for the <hi>good</hi> of them that are to obey; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any limitation or exception, he ſayes, Lord, <hi>Let thy Will be done,</hi> by me, in me, and upon me; for thy <hi>Will is my Sanctification,</hi> and whatever thou command'ſt me to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſuffer,</hi> my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eience whether <hi>active</hi> or <hi>paſſive</hi> will turn to <hi>thy Glory,</hi> to my <hi>own</hi> Comfort and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>8. Converſion is an <hi>inward thing;</hi> Rom.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106042:29"/> 2. 29. <hi>He is a Jew that is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the Heart, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the Letter, whoſe Praiſe is not of Men but of God.</hi> There is that in Converſion which the eyes of thoſe that are about us cannot ſee, but 'tis <hi>apparent</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> that <hi>ſearches the heart, and tries the reins, and has pleaſure in uprightneſs.</hi> Converting Grace reaches the inward parts, pierces into the <hi>very Soul,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> the greateſt change is wrought; there is a new light in the Mind and Conſcience, there is a new bent and diſpoſition in the Heart; the Soul has <hi>Wiſdom</hi> put into it that before was <hi>fooliſh,</hi> becomes <hi>true</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and to it <hi>ſelf,</hi> that before was <hi>falſe</hi> and unfaithful unto <hi>both;</hi> there is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual myſterious Life in the Soul, which before was dead, and <hi>this Life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3.

                  <p>To be Worſhipped with a pure Mind. Another ſayes,</p>

                  <p>9. Converſion though an inward thing, yet <hi>ſhews it ſelf viſibly in an anſwerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:</hi> Grace is an active Principle, and where 'tis wrought in the Heart, 'twill have an apparent influence upon the outward man, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 7.

                  </p>
                  <p>10. Converſion is <hi>gradual.</hi> We read in Scripture of different degrees of Grace: All Converts are not of the ſame Age, Strength and Stature. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>little Children,</hi> of <hi>young Men,</hi> and of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 12, 13. The little Child has as truly the Nature and all the Parts of a Man, as he that is grown up unto full maturity, but the grown Mans Parts and Members are much ſtronger than thoſe of the other. The young Convert has <hi>all the Parts</hi> of the new Creature, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>in the whole Man</hi> after the Image of God, though he be not <hi>wholly,</hi> but <hi>only in part</hi> renewed: And 'tis the Work of God, who has <hi>begun this good VVork</hi> of renovation, by degrees to <hi>perfect</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>The weakeſt Converts that are true, are not diſregarded, <hi>Mat. 12. 20. A bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, 'till he ſend forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Victory:</hi> The <hi>bruiſed reed</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Converts <hi>great Infirmity;</hi> the <hi>ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax,</hi> the <hi>noyſom mixture of much Sin</hi> with that little Grace he has received; yet that Grace is not, though ſmall, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but cheriſhed and increaſed, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Lord ſhews himſelf the <hi>true Meſſiah,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106042:30"/> a Saviour to the uttermoſt: Thus Judgment is brought forth to Victory and Truth.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrongeſt Converts are ſtill to grow ſtronger: There is ſome remaining Sin in the beſt of Saints, which they are ſtill to be turning from and purging out; neither are any of them come ſo near, or become ſo like to God, but they may be <hi>much nearer</hi> and <hi>liker</hi> to him. At firſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Day there is much darkneſs with the light, but by degrees the light increaſes, prevails againſt and expels the darkneſs: An apt Similitude to Illuſtrate the matter in hand, and to ſhew how that Converſion is by degrees compleated, <hi>Prov. 4. 18. The path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. Converſion may <hi>be known to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere:</hi> 'Tis <hi>poſſible</hi> for the Convert to be <hi>aſſured</hi> he is Converted; and what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> is conſequent upon ſuch an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance! For if a Man know that he is turned to God, he may warrantably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>God is turned unto him;</hi> and he may as warrantably inferr, that being turned to him, <hi>He will never turn away from him to do him good,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſuch Characters and Signs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Grace laid down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106042:31"/> if the thing were not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made evident? why are Prophets commanded to <hi>comfort</hi> the Converts, if none in this World could attain to a knowledge they are Converted? What Strangers are they to the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits <hi>ſealing of Believers to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and his <hi>bearing witneſs with their ſpirits that they are the Children of God, Rom.</hi> 8. 16. who deny aſſurance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation?</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Church</hi> which has been ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> againſt <hi>thoſe</hi> that have <hi>come out of her,</hi> is alſo <hi>hard-hearted</hi> to <hi>them</hi> that <hi>remain in Communion with her,</hi> for ſhe keeps Souls in torment, by encouraging <hi>Doubts and Fears;</hi> and by calling a confidence of Salvation, though never ſo Scriptural, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciam ab omni pietate alienam,</hi> an Impious Preſumption. But we are not to mind the dictates of ſuch a <hi>Step-mother,</hi> but hearken to a truer, a ſweeter and ſafer Guide, <hi>Heb. 3. 6. But Chriſt as a Son over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Converſion that is true is <hi>laſting:</hi> None ever totally and finally turn away from God, who are indeed turn'd to him. Chriſt the Mediator has made a firm Peace
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106042:31"/> between God, and thoſe that Believe and are Converted. The enmity between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and between <hi>them both</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>ſlain</hi> by the <hi>croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2. 16. Upon their turning and believing the Lord enters into a Covenant which he will <hi>never break.</hi> And as Chriſt by his Death has made <hi>an atonement,</hi> and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Fathers diſpleaſure; ſo his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion is effectual to the killing the <hi>enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that was <hi>naturally</hi> in <hi>Converts againſt God;</hi> their fleſh and the luſts of it are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>Gal. 5. 24. They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 6. 6. Knowing this, that our old man</hi> is <hi>crucified with Him, that the Body of Sin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve Sin.</hi> True Converts ſhall perſevere, for Chriſt has prayed that they may be eſtabliſht, <hi>kept from the evil of the World,</hi> and <hi>be with him where he is, and behold</hi> (which does imply the enjoyment of) <hi>his Glory,</hi> Joh. 17. 15, 24. <hi>Perſevering Grace</hi> is one thing <hi>Promiſed</hi> in the Covenant of Grace: God himſelf engages for thoſe that turn to him in Truth, that <hi>He</hi> will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to apoſtatize and periſh, <hi>Jer. 32. 40. I will put my fear into their Hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> I have done with the <hi>properties of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:106042:32"/>
                  <p>In the fourth place I am to demonſtrate the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Converſion: What tongue can name the thing that is of <hi>greater,</hi> or of <hi>ſo great</hi> neceſſity? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>one thing neceſſary.</hi> This has been neceſſary in <hi>all ages,</hi> ever ſince the fall of Man, and 'twill be neceſſary to the Worlds end, this is neceſſary for <hi>all ſorts of Perſons,</hi> Jews, Gentiles, high, low; rich, poor; young, old; male, female; bond, and free; all muſt of neceſſity periſh and that for ever without it. None but Converts <hi>will</hi> live <hi>to</hi> God in this World; <hi>ſhall</hi> live <hi>with</hi> Him in the World to come: We call Food to eat, and Raiment to put on, and Air to breath in, <hi>Neceſſaries;</hi> and ſo in a ſenſe they are, becauſe frail Nature cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without them; becauſe we muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>dye</hi> without them: But how <hi>much more</hi> neceſſary is Converſion, without which the <hi>precious Soul</hi> muſt needs be <hi>loſt;</hi> and there is no eſcaping <hi>eternal Death</hi> and Condemnation! The Arguments to prove the neceſſity of Converſion are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt ſhall be drawn from <hi>Gods frequent earneſt calls, and expreſs command.</hi> What <hi>voice</hi> has ſounded more frequently from <hi>Heaven,</hi> than that which <hi>requires</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:106042:32"/> Man to <hi>return</hi> to God? <hi>Hoſ. 14. 1. O Iſrael, return to the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquities.</hi> Jer. 3. 12. <hi>Go and proclaim theſe words towards the North, and ſay: Return thou backſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe my anger to fall upon thee, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord; and I will not keep anger for ever.</hi> The Proclamation was made towards the <hi>North</hi> whither <hi>Iſrael</hi> were carried Captives, to intimate their <hi>departing from their own land,</hi> was the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of their <hi>departing from the Lord,</hi> and ſincere <hi>returning</hi> unto God was the way to prevail with him <hi>to turn again their captivity.</hi> But now in Goſpel daies, the <hi>Proclamation</hi> is to be made Eaſt, and Weſt, and North, and South; even to <hi>every Creature,</hi> for now <hi>God commands all men every where to repent</hi> and return to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30.</p>
                  <p>This command is not properly a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires exact obedience, and without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of a tranſgreſſours Converſion; <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Yet it muſt be added, that Converſion includes a <hi>ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as the rigour of it is <hi>abated</hi> under the Goſpel. Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106042:33"/> is a command of a <hi>remedying Law</hi> given unto Man <hi>after the fall.</hi> To refuſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to obey and to return, is not only an affront of Gods <hi>Authority and Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> but a contempt of his <hi>gracious conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion</hi> towards man, and ſurely <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of his <hi>kindneſs and good will,</hi> muſt needs provoke the <hi>fiercer wrath.</hi> Converſion, or <hi>coming to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the great command of the Goſpel; know, that then when <hi>Converſion is preſs'd</hi> on Sinners, the <hi>Goſpel is indeed preached to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Converſion is neceſſary, becauſe <hi>Mans trueſt happineſs lies in God; whom he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to turn unto.</hi> 'Tis the Miſery of Hell, that the wicked Spirits there, are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ever from that God who made them. And 'tis the Worlds Miſery, that moſt men in it <hi>are <gap reason="foreign">

Here all the Creatures manifeſt their <hi>utter inſufficiency.</hi> Did the Rich mans <hi>purple cloathing, and fine tinnen, and delicious fare,</hi> make him an happy man? No, no; having this plenty and proſperity <hi>without God,</hi> it proved a means of loading him with the heavier guilt, and ſinking the Wretch into an hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and lower Hell. Mans happineſs does
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106042:33"/> certainly conſiſt in his being <hi>favoured</hi> of God, in his being admitted unto <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> with him, and <hi>transformed into his image and likeneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are <hi>far from him,</hi> are far from felicity; and are near periſhing, and though never ſo <hi>many,</hi> though <hi>whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> turn to Him, the Alſufficient God, <hi>has</hi> enough, <hi>is</hi> enough, for the happineſs of them All, <hi>Pſal. 33. 12. Bleſſed is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whoſe God is the Lord, and the People whom he hath choſen for his own inheritance.</hi> God is able to <hi>cure</hi> the Soul of Man, and to <hi>content</hi> it. A ſick man is uneaſiy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you lay him, 'till his diſeaſe be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: God can heal the Souls diſtempers; and ſatisfie its deſires, and fill it to the uttermoſt of its capacity. Therefore the Apoſtle prayes for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Eph. 3. 19. <hi>That they migbt be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> If our trueſt happineſs be a neceſſary thing, then Converſion to God is neceſſary; who <hi>himſelf</hi> really is that trueſt happineſs.</p>
                  <p>3. Converſion is neceſſary, becauſe of <hi>corrupted Nature, it's averſion from the Lord.</hi> Man is truly called a <hi>Tranſgreſſour from the womb,</hi> for behold <hi>he is ſhapen in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in ſin he was conceived,</hi> Pſal. 51. 5. Corrupted Nature is <hi>Abyſſus mali,</hi> an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106042:34"/> evil not to be fathom'd; they that are not <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it, plainly ſhew, that <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> and <hi>ſtupidneſs</hi> is <hi>added</hi> to their <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</hi> This corrupted Nature is called the <hi>Old Adam,</hi> which is full of <hi>deceitful luſts,</hi> a <hi>Body of ſin,</hi> which has a great many members. The higheſt faculties of the Soul are depraved. The <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be be made clean.</hi> The <hi>Mind</hi> is <hi>carnal,</hi> and <hi>enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can it be,</hi> Rom. 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>And as man is born with a ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to depart from God, ſo this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination quickly ſhews it ſelf, <hi>Pſal. 58. 3. The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they be born, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lies.</hi> And this eſtrangement from God is more and more increaſed by acts of Sin. And is not Converſion <hi>neceſſary,</hi> where there is <hi>ſuch a deep corruption and revolt?</hi> If the greater the Sickneſs, the greater be the need of the Phyſicians skill and care; then Mans <hi>alienation</hi> from God, <hi>highly needs converting Grace,</hi> which may perſwade and enable him to return, and this Grace is ſufficient to do it, <hi>Eph. 2. 5. Col. 1. 21. And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by reaſon of wicked, works, yet now hath he reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>

                  <p>4.

It looks into the very heart, and takes notice of all the imaginations, deſires, affections, projects that are evil. And as the Eye of God is <hi>piercing,</hi> ſo 'tis moſt <hi>pure.</hi> It ſees all iniquity, but does not <hi>behold</hi> ſo as to <hi>approve</hi> of any, <hi>Pſal. 5. 4, 5. Thou art not a God that haſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with thee; the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hateſt all the workers of iniquity.</hi> Wicked men indeed are apt to think that <hi>God is altogether ſuch an one as themſelves;</hi> and becauſe they like their own evil wayes, they can't imagine that He does ſo much diſlike them: But the wicked man, as he is called a <hi>fool,</hi> ſo he never ſhews himſelf <hi>more a fool,</hi> than when he concludes, that though he ſins, <hi>God is not angry at his ſin:</hi> this <hi>unbelief,</hi> this <hi>ſecurity,</hi> this <hi>most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy apprehenſion</hi> of God, ſtirs up the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er indignation</hi> againſt him, <hi>Pſal. 50. 21, 22.

                  </p>
                  <p>5. Converſion is neceſſary, becauſe of <hi>Gods immutability and unchangeableneſs.</hi> Can Gods pure and holy Nature ever alter? Can Light it ſelf become Darkneſs? can Perfection become Imperfect? Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels indeed changed and became Devils; many of them Apoſtatized, they <hi>kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Man <hi>was made upright,</hi> but he changed, he ſinn'd, and loſt his <hi>Glory</hi> in which he was created. But the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>with God there is no variableneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. 17.

                  <p>6. Converſion is neceſſary, becauſe it was <hi>one great end of Chriſts dying.</hi> Our Lord in his Crucifixion deſigned to ſave his Church from wrath, and this was a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106042:35"/> great benefit; he deſigned alſo to ſave his Church from Sin, <hi>Tit. 2. 14. VVho gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people zealous of good works:</hi> And if the Puniſhment of Sin be a leſs evil than Sin it ſelf, Redemption and Converſion from Sin is a greater benefit than bare deliverance from the Puniſhment due to it. Our Lord <hi>ſuffer'd for ſins, the just for the unjuſt,</hi> that he might make the unjuſt to become juſt, and <hi>might bring them unto God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. The Son of God was made <hi>Man,</hi> he was made <hi>Sin</hi> and a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> for it, that <hi>ſinful</hi> Men might turn and become <hi>Saints;</hi> he well knew how great an <hi>Evil,</hi> how dangerous an <hi>Enemy,</hi> how deadly a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> Sin is, and conſequently how <hi>needful</hi> it was his Church ſhould be Converted and Delivered from it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his great Love, Compaſſion and Care, moved him to <hi>give himſelf for his Church; that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it,</hi> Eph. 5. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>7. Converſion is neceſſary, becauſe it is <hi>one great reaſon of the Miſſion of the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> ſends the <hi>Son</hi> to dye, that <hi>ſin might dye,</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> converting from it <hi>might live:</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> ſends the <hi>Spirit,</hi> now one great work of the Spirit is to <hi>convince
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106042:36"/> the World of ſin,</hi> to ſhew the neceſſity of Converſion, and to work that which is ſo neceſſary. Converſion is a very great thing, and of the higheſt conſequence, in which the <hi>concurrence</hi> of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is very much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked: The <hi>Father allows</hi> of Converſion, gives the Sinner <hi>leave</hi> to turn, nay, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi> him to do it, with an <hi>encouraging ſignification,</hi> that he will <hi>receive</hi> him in Chriſt: The <hi>Son</hi> by his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> opens a <hi>way</hi> for the Sinner to come to the Father; and by the Price he paid, has <hi>purchaſed</hi> both the <hi>Sinner</hi> that is Converted, and <hi>Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace,</hi> whereby he comes to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted indeed: The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> works the <hi>change</hi> and <hi>makes</hi> the Convert; he <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Eyes of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> he ſets the <hi>Will at liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty:</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only to <hi>diſcern</hi> what is good, but Liberty to <hi>chuſe and embrace</hi> it. Finally, He changes the Soul into the divine <hi>Image,</hi> and he <hi>abides for ever</hi> in the Church of Chriſt, that he may hinder this Image from ever being quite defaced, that he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat it.</p>
                  <p>8. Converſion is neceſſary <hi>to fit for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Service and Duty.</hi> An Unconverted
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106042:36"/> Sinner is a bad Tree, and all the Fruit he bears muſt needs be evil. Is it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expect Figs from the Thiſtle, or Grapes from the Bramble or the Thorn? how can he whoſe Perſon is hateful to God, whoſe Heart never was ſanctified, do any action which may be truly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Gods ſight? <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that not only the <hi>Prayer of the wicked</hi> is an <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> to God, becauſe he <hi>turns away his ear from hearing the Law,</hi> Prov. 28. 9. but alſo, that the <hi>Ploughing of the wicked is ſin, Prov.</hi> 21. 4. If <hi>Ploughing</hi> be taken <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it intimates, that the wicked mans or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Employments are not without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, becauſe he does nothing in a right manner, to a good end: If Ploughing be taken <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> for <hi>Contriving and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning,</hi> it ſhews, that the Devices of the Heart of a wicked man are all vain and evil. Converſion therefore is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that Man may become meet for the Service of God. The Converts Heart is right with God, deſires God himſelf chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in what he does, deſigns his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and being made a <hi>ſanctified Veſſel,</hi> he is made fit <hi>for his Lords uſe,</hi> and <hi>prepared unto every good work,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 21.</p>
                  <p>9. Converſion is neceſſary to <hi>fit for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reward.</hi> We read that the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

The ſame Apoſtle having ſpoken of <hi>Life</hi> and Immortality, adds, <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who hath alſo given unto us the earneſt of the Spirit:</hi> By Converting Grace we are wrought upon for Glory; and the Spirit who works in us a new Life which is Spiritual, is an earneſt to aſſure us of Life Eternal: Oh Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> a City that has foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whoſe builder and maker is God! where Glory is everlaſting, Bleſſedneſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Joy is full, without poſſibility of abatement! into thee none but Converts <hi>ſhall have,</hi> or are <hi>fit to have</hi> admiſſion!</p>
                  <p>10. The <hi>Threatnings which the Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted,</hi> prove the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106042:37"/> 
                     <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Converſion. The only <hi>Saviour</hi> aſſerts with vehemency, and that again and again, aſſuring <hi>all,</hi> that there is <hi>no Salvation</hi> for the Impenitent, <hi>Luk. 13. 3, 5. Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> If Souls are Unconverted, Sin is certainly Unpardon'd, and unpardon'd Sin binds over to eternal Death: We are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Repent and be Converted, that our Sins may be blotted out,</hi> Act. 3. 19. Thoſe who refuſe to be Converted, all their Sins are written down in the book of Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, not one blotted out or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, which book will be open'd at the laſt day, to their Confuſion and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. What heavy loads are <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Wrath!</hi> both theſe abide upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.</p>
                  <p>How <hi>ſoon</hi> may the Wrath of God, which is both threatned and juſtly merited, ſeize upon the Unconverted! how <hi>ſuddainly</hi> may it deſtroy them beyond all poſſibility of remedy! <hi>Pſal. 7. 11, 12. God is angry with the wicked every day;</hi> and as he grows more wicked, God becomes more angry: <hi>If he</hi> turn not, <hi>he hath whet his Sword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready:</hi> To ſignifie the <hi>Patience</hi> of God, and his <hi>unwillingneſs to deſtroy,</hi> the <hi>ſlaughtering Weapons</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as lying by him <hi>unprepared,</hi> his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106042:38"/> 
                     <hi>Sword is not whetted,</hi> his <hi>Bow is unbent;</hi> but if Sinners <hi>refuſe</hi> to <hi>turn,</hi> the Sword, the Bow may quickly be made ready, and God may come to that peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, <hi>Iſa. 1. 24. Ah! I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries, and avenge me of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Turning you ſee is in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neceſſary, for you muſt <hi>turn</hi> or <hi>dye:</hi> If a City were on fire, and there were but <hi>one Gate</hi> at which there might be an egreſs, to fly from the fury of the flames. Oh! what flocking would there be to <hi>that Gate!</hi> If Sinners had but any <hi>ſenſe and knowledge,</hi> they would turn to God by <hi>thouſands and by millions,</hi> ſince <hi>Converſion</hi> is the <hi>only Door</hi> through which they may eſcape the Vengeance of eternal Fire: Thoſe obſtinate Wretches that <hi>will not turn</hi> in time, God will make them <hi>burn</hi> in Hell for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I at large demonſtrated the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Converſion: But alas! <hi>VVho believes our report!</hi> who credits that which is of all the greateſt certainty! Neceſſity in <hi>other</hi> matters has a <hi>mighty force,</hi> but the <hi>Neceſſity of Converſion</hi> prevails with <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few.</hi> I make a needful <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> from <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himſelf.</p>

And I would not leave one of them undemoliſhed. <hi>Removere prohibens,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the hindrance of Converſion, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much conducing to the thing it ſelf; therefore I ſhall (which is but needful) be the larger, in producing the <hi>ſtrongeſt Reaſons</hi> and moſt <hi>forcible Pleas</hi> that are brought and uſed againſt <hi>Sinners turning to God;</hi> and give a <hi>full</hi> Anſwer, ſhewing the <hi>miſerable invalidity and weakneſs</hi> of them <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. The firſt Objection againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is this; <hi>We are Members of the Chriſtian Church already.</hi> We have been <hi>Baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:</hi> If indeed we were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens or Infidels, 'twere proper to call us to turn to the true God, and to embrace the Faith of Chriſt; but ſince we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Baptized into the Church, which is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106042:39"/> his Body, the <hi>Call and Invitation to turn</hi> ſeems not to be <hi>made to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is one thing to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and another thing to be <hi>really</hi> a <hi>Member of Christ:</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes, <hi>All are not Iſrael who are of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Rom. 9. 6. Many have a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs without the Power. In the ſame Vine there are many fruitleſs as well as fruitful Branches: In the ſame Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, many unſound Profeſſors, if not more in number than ſincere Believers: Now becauſe theſe Saints in <hi>ſhew only,</hi> ſeem to be near to God, but their Hearts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>removed far from him,</hi> they have need to return to him as well as the openly Prophane.</p>
                  <p>2. Baptiſm and Converſion are <hi>ſeparable. Simon Magus</hi> was under a Conviction by the Miracles which were wrought for the Confirmation of the Goſpel, that it was <hi>from Heaven;</hi> and he was Baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> who did his Duty in adminiſtring that Ordinance to him; yet afterwards <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter</hi> tells him plainly, that his <hi>Heart was not right with God, but he was in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Act. 8. 21, 23.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Jews</hi> of old <hi>were of the Church of God,</hi> and yet how often are they <hi>Called to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106042:39"/> turn?</hi> Will Church-members, without Converſion be the better for their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip? Oh no. Sin in them is more inexcuſable, they add treachery and perfidiouſneſs to their iniquity; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their <hi>Provocation is,</hi> and their <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be</hi> the more increaſed, <hi>Amos 3. 2. You onely have I known of all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Earth, therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> Your Sins by my Favour and your Priviledges are aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore your Condemnation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Converſion will be much the ſorer.</p>
                  <p>4. Your Baptiſm is ſo far from <hi>proving Converſion needleſs,</hi> that it <hi>strengthens your obligation</hi> to turn to God: And indeed as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of old, which was a <hi>Seal of the ſame Covenant;</hi> it may be improved this way. Under the Old Teſtament, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that in <hi>Infancy</hi> had been <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the fleſh,</hi> might go unto God for <hi>Converting Grace,</hi> for a <hi>circumciſed Heart,</hi> and go to him as unto a God who had <hi>ſealed a Covenant</hi> to him. <hi>Ephraim</hi> upon this ſcore calls the Lord <hi>his</hi> God; when he cries to him to be turned, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord</hi> my <hi>God;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Lord! I have been circumciſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto Thee, and laid under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106042:40"/> to be Thine: Oh circumciſe and turn my Heart, that I may be</hi> Thine <hi>indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do the Children of Believers under the Goſpel, want ſuch an help to Converſion, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Children under the Law had? Did Chriſt come to turn Infants out of Covenant who were once taken in, and to leſſen the Saints Priviledgs inſtead of enlarging and augmenting them? No, no. He that has been baptized, and received this Seal of the New Teſtament; may with conſidence addreſs unto God, and ſay, <hi>Lord! I have been baptized with</hi> Water, <hi>Oh! ſprinckle me with the</hi> Blood of Jeſus, <hi>baptize me with</hi> his Spirit, <hi>waſh me thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from my iniquity, cleanſe and turn my Heart to Thee, and make me faithful and stedfast in thy Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. The ſecond Objection againſt Converſion is this, <hi>We are not as other men are, and have no need to turn.</hi> Our lives have been unſpotted, none can charge us with Extortion, with Injuſtice or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; who can accuſe us of a fault that we ſhould concern our ſelves to mend? Had we indeed been groſs offenders, Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reformation would have been our Duty: But the Letter of Gods commands we have obſerved, and refuſed to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, like others, from our youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. An <hi>unblameable Converſation I would not let paſs without the Commendation that's due to it.</hi> 'Tis well that many who are Strangers to God, are under ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, by Education, Laws, Shame, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience, elſe the World might quickly be too hot for any that are born of God to live in it. The young Man in the Goſpel, who was ſo exact in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, 'tis ſaid our Lord <hi>loved him,</hi> Mar. 10. 21. though he himſelf loved <hi>his Poſſeſſions</hi> before a Saviour, and a <hi>Treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>

                  <p>3. You that are not of vicious Lives, <hi>Have you ſtudied the Corruption of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> Chriſt tells you, that, <hi>that which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3. 6.

                  <p>3.

But if he <hi>turn to God,</hi> and <hi>take heed to himſelf</hi> according to the Words Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Command, his <hi>Heart</hi> ſhall be made and kept <hi>pure,</hi> his <hi>Veſſel ſhall be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in Sanctification and Honour;</hi> and though Youth be a dangerous Age, the Grace of God ſhall be ſufficient for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>4. You that are born of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>God has challenged a ſpecial intereſt in you, from your very Infancy.</hi>

                  <p>5.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Converſion only <hi>baniſhes the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are ſinful;</hi> and to take Pleaſure in Sin, how unreaſonable is it? ſhould it be counted a Pleaſure to anger the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? to lay our ſelves under a Curſe which none can bear, without being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wretched? ſhould it be counted a Pleaſure to expoſe our ſelves to all ſorts of Judgments and Calamities in this life? to wound the Conſcience, to damn the Soul for ever? Is there any eaſe in Hell? are thoſe Burnings become deſirable? and ſhould Pleaſure be taken in Sin, which if ſtill delighted in, will certainly bring us to thoſe Torments? Lovers of ſinful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures underſtand not Pleaſures: All theſe kind of Delights are to be ſhunn'd, for they have as it were an intoxicating and ſtupifying Poyſon in the mouth, and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sting in the tail of them.</p>
                  <p>2. Converſion <hi>ſpiritualizes and hightens the Pleaſures that are innocent and lawful:</hi> He
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106042:44"/> that keeps within the bounds that God has ſet him, conſults his own Peace. When <hi>God</hi> is <hi>eyed</hi> and <hi>ſerved in the abundance of all things,</hi> there is the greater <hi>Joy</hi> in that abundance, as is intimated, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 47.

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. In the fifth place, there be that argue thus againſt Converſion: If we turn to God, <hi>we ſhall be expoſed to Contempt and Reproach:</hi> How many Mouths will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd againſt us? how many Tongues will ſpeak evil of us? we ſhall perfectly be made the meer foot-balls of diſdain, if we become indeed religious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. A <hi>wiſe Man</hi> ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at the <hi>diſeſteem</hi> of <hi>Fools and Mad men;</hi> ſo wicked men are called, and ſuch and no better indeed they are. If all the poor Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks in <hi>Bedlam</hi> ſhould deride you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of your ſober Carriage, you would not mind them, unleſs it were to pity them, becauſe you would know your ſelves to be <hi>in your Wits,</hi> and them to be <hi>out of theirs.</hi> When wicked ones do make a <hi>mock of Sin,</hi> 'tis a ſign that they are in a ſpiritual ſenſe <hi>delirious,</hi> and when they prate againſt Religion, this is really their <hi>frantick raving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To be <hi>Reproached, is better than to be Commended of the World:</hi> You would be none of the beſt your ſelves, if you had
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106042:45"/> the good word of all that are bad: Chriſt himſelf ſayes, <hi>Woe unto you, when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you,</hi> Luk. 6. 26. Reproach for Religion and Righteouſneſs ſake, is a far greater Honour than the eſteem of all the Men of the World. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from being diſcouraged, that he <hi>took Pleaſure in Reproaches,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10. And <hi>Moſes</hi> before him, had <hi>eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11. 26.</p>
                  <p>3. Better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men reproach thee for thy Converſion, <hi>than Conſcience reproach thee for thy Obſtinacy:</hi> The reproaches of an awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, a wounded Conſcience, will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible, not to be denied, not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, not to be endured: As long as <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>Heart did not reproach him,</hi> but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed his Integrity, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 5, 6. he could bear his unfriendly Friends Cenſures and Reproaches the better.</p>
                  <p>4. Whatever the World judges, <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is exceedingly for the honour of all that are Converted.</hi> All Unconverted ones are really vile and abominable, ſlaves to their luſts, the unclean Spirits drudges; they are moſt baſely employed, becauſe employed in works that are evil. But the Convert has a real excellency, he partakes of a new, of a divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. How
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106042:46"/> highly is he advanced, who is promoted to be a <hi>Child,</hi> an <hi>Heir of God,</hi> a <hi>Joint-heir with Chriſt!</hi> Prieſtly, nay, <hi>Kingly</hi> dignity is put upon him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6. Oh mind not the ſcoffs and ſcorn of the fooliſh. To have God to be your Father, Chriſt your Brother, the Holy Angels miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to you, to be enriched with Grace, and at laſt Crown'd with Glory, cannot juſtly be look'd upon as a matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to any.</p>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. There be ſome that further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt Converſion: This is a thing <hi>may coſt us very dear,</hi> we may come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſuffer the loſs of Liberty, Eſtate and Life; how many <hi>Thouſands</hi> of <hi>Martyrs</hi> have there been, ſince there was a Church ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd out of the World, and Converted to God through Chriſt Jeſus? Death came to theſe <hi>before the time,</hi> and came <hi>with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and the <hi>Torments</hi> they endured, made them ſuffer <hi>many Deaths in one:</hi> 'Tis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to be <hi>ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, ſlain with the Sword,</hi> burnt to aſhes at a ſtake; or if it come not to this, 'tis ſad enough <hi>to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, being deſtitute and afflicted,</hi> and forced <hi>to dwell in Dens and Caves of the earth:</hi> Flames, Swords, Racks, Gibbets, are none of the moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things to perſwade unto Converſion.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106042:46"/> Unto this affrighting Objection, I thus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Though all ſhould <hi>count the Coſt</hi> of being Converts, and reckon upon the Croſs, yet all are not put upon <hi>bearing the heavieſt part of it;</hi> though many have ſail'd through a <hi>very tempeſtuous Ocean</hi> to Heaven, yet many have alſo through a <hi>calmer Sea</hi> arrived ſafe thither. The Church of Chriſt has its lucid Intervals, and for many years in ſome places there is not the <hi>fiery Tryal:</hi> The God whom they ſerve, <hi>takes away the righteous</hi> very frequently <hi>from the evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57. 1, 2. and they are <hi>ſafe at reſt above,</hi> before the <hi>ſtorm here below riſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There is a Promiſe made to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, of <hi>ſo much of this World</hi> as God ſees to be <hi>good for them;</hi> and he is beſt able to judge what is indeed convenient: So that Godlineſs is really a gainful thing, and has the Promiſe <hi>of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. While the Lord ſees it expedient, his Saints ſhould keep their temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that fence his Providence has ſet about them, will ſecure them from the ſons of violence, <hi>Heb. 13. 5, 6. Let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be without Covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for He hath
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106042:47"/> ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee: So that we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. All <hi>loſſes for Religion are ſanctified,</hi> and the Soul gains ſo much Grace and Peace when temporal goods are taken away, that in point of <hi>value,</hi> the Sufferer receives in <hi>this life an hundred-fold,</hi> Mar. 10. 30. He that receives a Wedge of maſſy Gold from the hand that took away a few Farthings, has he reaſon to complain of being a looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? leſs reaſon has he to cry out of loſs, who has <hi>leſs</hi> of <hi>the World,</hi> but <hi>much more Grace</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Joy</hi> than ever.</p>
                  <p>4. If Converts are called to <hi>Martyrdom and extraordinary Trials, extraordinary Strength</hi> ſhall be vouchſafed; for <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer</hi> any of his <hi>to be tempted above what they are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13. The greater the Saints ſufferings are, the greater honour is put upon them, and the greater is their ſupport and comfort: Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Sufferings, and abundant Conſolation to ſweeten them, go together, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 5. For as the Sufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis ill indeed to <hi>ſuffer as an evil doer,</hi> or as a <hi>buſie body</hi> in that which it does not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to be doing;</hi> but to ſuffer as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106042:47"/> as a Convert, is an happy thing, and ſhould be rejoyced in; becauſe the <hi>Spirit of Glory and of God, does reſt upon</hi> thoſe that thus bear the Croſs of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13, 14. He gives them <hi>boldneſs</hi> in Confeſſing the Truth, a Mouth and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſilence thoſe that gainſay it, and Faith, Fortitude and Patience, to bear the uttermoſt of their Force and Fury. A <hi>fiery Furnace,</hi> though <hi>ſeven times heated,</hi> is not to be dreaded, if the <hi>Son of God</hi> be there with us.</p>
                  <p>5. None that come to Heaven repent of having <hi>parted</hi> with <hi>any thing,</hi> that ſtood in <hi>competition</hi> with it. The Apoſtle while <hi>here</hi> called Afflictions <hi>light,</hi> but how did he look on them, when they were all paſt, and the <hi>weight of Glory</hi> was actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? All Heads are Crowned in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all Crowns are bright; all Veſſels of glory are ſo full, that there is not room for the leaſt envy, yet there ſeems to be a ſpecial note of Honour ſet upon Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; the Scripture repreſents them as point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, for their Faithfulneſs and for their Reward, <hi>Rev. 7. 14. Theſe are they that came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106042:48"/> runs thus, We ſee <hi>very few that are perſwaded to turn to God;</hi> the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe whom we live among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Unconverted, and why ſhould <hi>we</hi> be <hi>ſingular?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>general bad Example</hi> that is given, is a <hi>great miſchief</hi> to the World, whereby wicked men do harden one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A few indeed there be that are choſen out of the World, and who do ſeek and chuſe a better World, but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality are worldly minded; the <hi>ſhrodeſt Heads,</hi> the <hi>greateſt Wits,</hi> the <hi>deepeſt Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> mind Earth and neglect Heaven, and refuſe to be Converted that they may come thither; and multitudes going in pernicious wayes, they are walked in with the <hi>greater ſecurity,</hi> yet they are not at all the <hi>leſs</hi> deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>2. Is it any harm to be <hi>ſingular in what is excellent?</hi> To be ſingular in good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be ſingular in Parts, to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in Learning, is not matter of reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and why ſhould it be accounted diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to be ſingular in Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? He that ſayes, <hi>Mat. 7. 14. Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it;</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates plainly, that his followers muſt not herd with the multitude, and that thoſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106042:48"/> muſt be ſingular, who will go in the ſafeſt and moſt excellent way.</p>
                  <p>3. Is it any harm in a time of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to be of the <hi>Number of thoſe few that eſcape the Contagion?</hi> Sin is the worſt ſort of Plague, and moſt in the World dye of it, and dye the Death that is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: Oh what madneſs is it to refuſe to be Converted and healed, and to reſolve to dye and to be damn'd for Company?</p>
                  <p>4. Multitudes in Hell will be <hi>no eaſe or relief to one another.</hi> They that have been drawn to Sin, by others; with what eyes will they behold them in torments, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Counſel and Example they gave them; and eſpecially their own madneſs in imitating ſuch pernicious Patterns! And the perſwaders to Sin, will have their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery increaſed, becauſe they have occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned others eternal miſery. 'Tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. was afraid of having his <hi>own torment</hi> increaſed by his <hi>Brethrens company,</hi> unto whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he had been exemplary in Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Senſuality; therefore he wiſh'd them a Meſſenger <hi>from the Dead,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to <hi>Repentance.</hi>

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. In the eighth place, another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is this. <hi>We have no ſtrength, no ability to turn to God.</hi> If we were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I grant mans <hi>inability</hi> to <hi>make himſelf</hi> a <hi>ſincere Convert;</hi> to turn, is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Duty, but from hence it does not follow that he has ability of himſelf to do it.

But if you are <hi>ſenſible</hi> you have <hi>no might,</hi> and deſire Power from above, God is ready to ſtrengthen you by his Spirit, to that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Nature is unable.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. A ninth Objection is this, Though we do not turn to God at preſent, yet we are not <hi>abſolutely againſt the thing; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi> we intend to do it. This is both an <hi>excuſe</hi> for not turning, and an <hi>argument
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106042:50"/> againſt</hi> the preſent doing it; becauſe 'tis time enough, as they ſay, hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Delay to turn to God, is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd upon <hi>very great miſtakes,</hi> as if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners could <hi>turn when they would,</hi> or could <hi>command the Grace</hi> of God at <hi>Pleaſure to aſſiſt them,</hi> or were ſure of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>ſeaſon of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Delay <hi>provokes</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> exceedingly, and very much <hi>grieves</hi> his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> if a Maſter commands a Servant to do his work; and he replyes he will do it <hi>ſeven year hence,</hi> this is juſtly look't upon as diſobedience and mockery joyn'd together. How would a Maſter on Earth take ſuch an Anſwer? Surely it muſt needs anger the God of Heaven, who bids you turn to day; to ſay that ſeven, and ſeven, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years after that, will be time enough to do it. The Spirit urges to <hi>preſent</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; delay vexes the Holy Ghoſt, and being vexed he may give <hi>over ſtriving, Gen. 6. 3. My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man.</hi> And if he be quite gone, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion becomes impoſſible, you never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can, or will be turned.</p>
                  <p>3. Delay <hi>hardens the unconverted.</hi> Satans holds are ſtronger, Sin is rooted deeper; Conſcience is more ſtupified; Cuſtom in Sin, more fully takes away the Senſe of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106042:50"/> it. And ſurely the more dead aſleep the Conſcience is, the more unlikely 'tis to be awakened; the more the Heart is like an Adamant ſtone, the more improbable 'tis that ever it ſhould be mollified.</p>
                  <p>4. Delayes are <hi>unconceivably dangerous;</hi> 'tis far greater folly to defer thy turning to God, than if thou ſhouldſt defer the cutting off a Grangren'd member, or than if thy houſe were on fire, and thou ſhouldſt ſay, <hi>A twelve month, or ſeven year hence were time enough to put out the flame.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Some have been <hi>Converted very late.</hi> Grace has recover'd them that have been <hi>very far gone</hi> in Sin, and by Sin have been brought to the very brink of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> I. If Converſion be thus neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the great thing which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; learn from hence the <hi>great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that there is, in being miſtaken about Converſion.</hi> To miſtake counterfeit Coyn for good and lawful Money, to purchaſe an Eſtate upon a falſe Title inſtead of a ſound, and true one; to place Confidence in one that ſeems a Friend, but is really faithleſs, and an Enemy; all ſuch miſtakes are accounted dangerous and hurtful. But no miſtakes in Point of Prejudice and Miſchievouſneſs, are comparable to <hi>this;</hi> when that which is <hi>not Grace</hi> is taken to <hi>be the Grace of God in Truth.</hi> It is an Obſervation, that <hi>Fraus oritur ex ſimilitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> Deceit ariſes from likeneſs: There are many things that have ſome kind of <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Converſion,</hi> that <hi>indeed are not</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; theſe I am with all faithfulneſs to diſcover to you, and you with all care are to heed the diſcovery; for if you ſhould deceive your own ſelves, and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake about Converting Grace,</hi> you would
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106042:53"/> be for ever <hi>fruſtrated in your hopes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> And can there be a greater diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than confidently to expect Heaven, and find your ſelves not only excluded, but Sentenc'd and ſent to that place of Woe, where there is the <hi>greateſt loſs,</hi> and that loſs <hi>irreparable;</hi> where there is the <hi>greateſt Pain and Torment,</hi> without any <hi>hope of eaſe or end:</hi> The things that are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Converſion are theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>turning to a Party and Opinion,</hi> there may be this, where there is no turning unto God. An Orthodox Judgment there may be where there is an unrenewed Heart, and Truth may have many to ſide with it upon the account of ſecular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: What Multitudes followed Chriſt for the <hi>Loaves,</hi> whoſe Hearts reliſhed not his <hi>Doctrine</hi> nor <hi>himſelf;</hi> though he is the <hi>Bread of God that came down from Heaven to give Life unto the World,</hi> Joh. 6. 26, 27, 33. 'Tis good indeed to profeſs what is indeed the Truth, and to be of that party which is moſt ſober and Godly. But the <hi>Girdle of Truth,</hi> will ſignifie lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without the <hi>Breaſt-plate of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> the form of Godlineſs will not avail, if the Heart be a ſtranger to, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſlike the Power of Godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judas</hi> was turned to the Doctrine of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106042:54"/> Chriſt as to an Opinion, and he aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with the moſt eminent of the Diſciples, being one of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but he valued the <hi>Bagg</hi> more than the <hi>Faith;</hi> he talkt like a Follower of Chriſt; but his Heart went after his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and at laſt for <hi>thirty pieces of Silver</hi> he <hi>ſold</hi> his Lord, and <hi>loſt</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Take heed of ſuch an imagination, that if you are of ſuch a way, or party, or Congregation, you are certainly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. In the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was a falſe and diſſembling <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> Act. 5. 1, -4. In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> there were <hi>ſome that had not the Knowledge of God,</hi> who were aſleep in Sin, and whom the Apoſtle endeavours to <hi>awake to Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 34. There may be turning to a <hi>party</hi> without <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Purity,</hi> and this is but turning the <hi>Church</hi> into a <hi>Stage,</hi> and <hi>acting a part</hi> there. And as turning to a party is not <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> ſo ceaſing to be <hi>fierce</hi> for a party, is not <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> but 'tis a <hi>Moderate healing temper,</hi> which would do a <hi>mighty kindneſs</hi> at <hi>this day;</hi> and have a great tendency to the Churches <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Zeal about <hi>Circumſtantials in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is miſtaken for Converſion. This ſort of Zeal is ſometimes joyn'd with <hi>groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:106042:54"/> and then 'tis <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> a <hi>fooliſh fire;</hi> and ſometimes 'tis joyn'd with great <hi>impatience and fury</hi> againſt every thing that ſtands in it's way, and then 'tis perfect <hi>Wild-fire.</hi> In the Apoſtles dayes, ſome were exceeding hot for <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> Others did as loudly cry up <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> But the Apoſtle decryes the Ardour and heat both of the one and the other party, and plainly tells them, that <hi>Neither Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion;</hi> neither of theſe things by themſelves, can prove a man a Convert, and in a State of Salvation; but a <hi>new Creature,</hi> but <hi>Faith which worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that place all Religion in <hi>bare Conformity,</hi> and are eager for Ceremonies, but neglect the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, and remain without Faith, Truth, Love, Humility and ſerious Holineſs; they will find theſe Ceremonies inſignificant to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them at Death and Judgment. And on the other ſide, they who place all their Religion in <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> but yet are greatly conſormed to a vain and ſinful World, are as proud, envious and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as ſenſual and covetous, as intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, unjuſt and unclean as others in the World are; though theſe ſeem to go in a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106042:55"/> 
                     <hi>different path,</hi> yet 'tis a path in the <hi>ſame broad way</hi> that leads to Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>3. Turning to <hi>Errour,</hi> and <hi>forwardneſs to promote errours that are very dangerous,</hi> is alſo miſtaken for Converſion. Many that are <hi>unlearned and unſtable, do wreſt the Scriptures to their own Deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16. and yet vainly ſuppoſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the Faith, and are in the right way to Salvation, this is not Converſion but <hi>Deluſion;</hi> and the greater the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, the Deluſion is the ſtronger. When <hi>Satan transforms himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light,</hi> and his Miniſters appear <hi>as the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and Errour is <hi>dreſs't up,</hi> as if it were moſt <hi>certain and Sacred Truth;</hi> how many are led away, and believe lies; and are induſtrious to perſwade others alſo to believe them! And <hi>ſo much</hi> is placed in the embracing of theſe falſhoods, as if it were <hi>damnable</hi> to <hi>reject</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But I Counſel you to remember that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 20. that turning <hi>from</hi> an Errour and not <hi>to</hi> it, is the way to ſave a Soul from Death. Obſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe deluded ones, whether ſome ſpiritual Pride, or carnal Affection, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Omiſſions, were not the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their being perverted; whether
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106042:55"/> they don't allow themſelves in the neglect of plainly commanded Duties, bearing ſome <hi>fruits</hi> or other which <hi>diſcover</hi> them: And whatever Joyes and Comforts they bragg of, they had better be without them, ſince they ſerve only as confirming Seals of their Deluſions.</p>
                  <p>4. Another thing miſtaken for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is <hi>forſaking of One ſin, though there be a running into the contrary,</hi> at leaſt an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of ſome Iniquity or other ſtill: He that has been exceedingly addicted to Prodigality, ceaſes perhaps his Profuſeneſs and Luxury, but runs into the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and becomes exceſſively greedy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gain; this Man has not turned from <hi>ſin to God,</hi> but from <hi>one ſin to another.</hi> To reform in one thing, nay, in many things, is inſufficient, if the Reformation be not univerſal; one ſin loved and liv'd in, is enough to prove one Unconverted, and will be ſufficient to deſtroy: A Man that has one Dagger thruſt into his Heart, dyes as certainly as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> did, of all the Wounds which were given him in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;</hi> or as <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> did, who was pierced from Head to Foot in the <hi>nayled Barrel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. A <hi>blameleſs Converſation</hi> is alſo miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Converſion, though there be no
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106042:56"/> 
                     <hi>Care or Obſervation,</hi> no <hi>Renovation of the Heart and Nature:</hi> The righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees was ſhort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe only external; if they imbrued not <hi>their hands in blood,</hi> they were unconcern'd, though their Hearts were full of <hi>Wrath and Hatred;</hi> if free from <hi>actual Adultery,</hi> inward <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> was <hi>nothing</hi> with them: But our Lord rightly expounds the Law, ſhews how being ſpiritual, it reaches the Soul, and obliges unto internal Purity and Righteouſneſs; and he expreſsly affirms, <hi>Mat. 5. 20. Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, before his Converſion he <hi>was, touching the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law blameleſs,</hi> Phil. 3. 6. Yet though his Life were free from blame, and ordered according to a more than ordinary Phariſaical ſtrictneſs and ſeverity, yet his Heart was void of ſaving Grace, 'till he was beaten off from Confidence in himſelf, and he was turned to the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>6. Bodily <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>good Nature</hi> is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken for Converſion: Some by reaſon of their Conſtitutions are <hi>naturally Mild,</hi> they take this for the <hi>Grace of Patience,</hi> and for the <hi>meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt;</hi> 'tis the temper of ſome to be <hi>Liberal and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106042:56"/> Free-hearted,</hi> they take this for the <hi>Grace of Chriſtian Charity:</hi> When they behold others of crooked and crabbed Diſpoſitions, and perceive themſelves of a more even and loving temper; they are very apt to be deceived, in judging what is the <hi>effect</hi> of their <hi>natural temperament,</hi> to be the <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying work</hi> of the <hi>Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it:</hi> But Oh, how much does Converting Grace differ from meer Nature, when moſt reſined! He that is naturally Patient, is not ſo in <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, but becauſe Nature <hi>inclines him not</hi> to be <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> Nature has no regard to the <hi>pleaſing of God,</hi> nor to the <hi>enjoying of him;</hi> neither does it <hi>deſire help</hi> from him, but is <hi>centred in it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>well enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented</hi> without him.</p>
                  <p>7. Another thing miſtaken for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is <hi>Education, and reſtraining Grace:</hi> Some that have been brought up under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Parents, and have lived in places free from Temptation, and by this means have been preſerved from the Worlds Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, they are very apt to call that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Grace,</hi> which is no more than <hi>Grace reſtraining:</hi> But when theſe do change their Place, and change their Company, how does Corruption diſcover it ſelf? Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence very ſad has ſhewn, that they who under their Parents eyes and care have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106042:57"/> ſeemed very ſerious and well inclined, when their Parents have been removed by Death, all the good Inclinations of the Children, have been as it were buried in their Parents graves; and with a ſtrange kind of eagerneſs have they run out to great exceſs of riot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joaſh,</hi> during the Life of <hi>Jehoiada the Prieſt,</hi> who had ſaved him from being Murther'd, and brought him to the Throne, ſeemed a Prince very well Inclined, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jehoiada</hi> his Death, all his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs vaniſhed, he left the Lord Jehovah, and ſhamefully Apoſtatized into Idolatry; and when he was faithfully reproved by <hi>Zachariah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> he <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> him to be <hi>Stoned:</hi> Wicked and Ungrateful Man! thus to take away the Life of the Son, who was himſelf preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 17,—23. And truly, if you obſerve Education and reſtraining Grace at the <hi>very beſt,</hi> when it has moſt <hi>kept</hi> Perſons <hi>within compaſs,</hi> yet even then there is a <hi>levity of ſpirit</hi> in them that are thus reſtrained; ſerious Diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are not ſo ſavoury to them, as thoſe that are more frothy and vain; and upon Self-reflection they may obſerve in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>ſecret diſlike</hi> of Religion and <hi>ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which they dare not <hi>openly</hi> ſhew.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106042:57"/>
                  <p>8. Conviction in <hi>the Conſcience</hi> is alſo miſtaken for Converſion: When Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is thoroughly awakened, and the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage</hi> cauſes great <hi>fear</hi> of Wrath; when Mercy is implored, and Pardon of Sin is begg'd with great earneſtneſs, and the force of Conſcience produces a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſeveral Miſcarriages; this may ſeem Converſion, and ſometimes ends in it, and it often iſſues otherwiſe. <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi> under Conviction, cryes out, <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> reſolves <hi>to let Iſrael go,</hi> deſires <hi>Moſes his Prayers</hi> for him, yet after this <hi>hardens his Heart,</hi> and that Obduration ended in his Deſtruction. The Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under Affliction and Conviction together, <hi>when God ſlew them, then they ſought him, they returned and enquired early after God; they remembred God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer:</hi> And yet though Conſcience compell'd them thus far, their Heart remained Unconverted, was <hi>not right with God, neither were they ſtedfast in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78. 34,—37. There may be amazing terrour in the Conſcience, and yet the Heart remain <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> endeavouring to caſt the <hi>awakened</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience into a <hi>dead ſlaep</hi> again, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any check or trouble it may return to its former perverſe and evil way.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106042:58"/>
                  <p>9. Temporary <hi>Faith and forwardneſs in Profeſſion</hi> is likewiſe miſtaken for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Thoſe Hearers of the Goſpel whom our Lord compares to the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> were forward to hear, and received the Word <hi>with joy,</hi> and for a <hi>while believed;</hi> they aſſented to the Truth of the Word, and look'd upon it as worthy of accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it was not <hi>ſo acceptable</hi> in their account, as to make them willing <hi>to loſe all</hi> for the ſake of it; thus <hi>far,</hi> thus <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> it had not <hi>taken root</hi> in them; therefore <hi>when Perſecution aroſe becauſe of the Word, they were offended,</hi> and in <hi>time of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they fell away,</hi> Luk. 8. 13. Theſe joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forward Profeſſors ſeemed Converts, but really were not Converted: Neither were thoſe that went a degree further, who brought forth, not only the <hi>blade</hi> of an external Profeſſion, but alſo <hi>ſome fruit;</hi> but being <hi>choaked with cares and riches, and the pleaſures of this life,</hi> did not <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Gifts are to be <hi>earneſtly Coveted,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. <hi>ult.</hi> yet they are not too much to be magnified: A man may have the <hi>Gift of Prophecy,</hi> who is not a <hi>Saint,</hi> but a <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7. 22, 23. A man may have the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> that has not the <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplication;</hi> and then, though he Prayes never ſo well as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Expreſſion, yet his Heart being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, proud, ſelf-conceited, ſelf-deſigning in his Duties, he is really to be rank'd among the <hi>carnal and the formal Worſhippers:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many Praying lips are there cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, wrathful, luſtful and haughty Hearts? and theſe <hi>Hearts are far from God,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good words are given to him: And if the <hi>Heart</hi> is <hi>abſent</hi> from a Duty, <hi>God</hi> is alſo <hi>abſent;</hi> and that Duty, as ſplendid

                     <hi>Judas</hi> had Gifts, and ſo had <hi>Demas,</hi> but had they ſaving Grace? this World had the higheſt room in the Heart of the one and of the other. I read in Scripture that an <hi>evil Spirit</hi> came upon <hi>Saul,</hi> and he fell a <hi>Propheſying in the houſe,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 10. I have read of a <hi>Scottiſh Major</hi> who excelled in the Gift of Prayer, but had made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the Devil. O Profeſſor! do not reſt and glory in thy Gifts, but humbly uſe them, and be ſure let it be within the ſphere of thy Calling.

                  <p>Thus have I diſcover'd many miſtakes about Converſion, that your danger might be apprehended and avoided: And pray remember that <hi>groundleſs Confidence</hi> you <hi>are</hi> Converted, is one of the <hi>ſtrongeſt barrs</hi> againſt the Grace of God, one of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt hindrances of Converſion.

                  <p>6. Turn ye, <hi>Why will ye Dye?</hi> Is the Guilt of Sin become a light matter? the Wrath of the Almighty eaſie to be born?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106042:68"/> do you make a mock of that which makes <hi>the whole Creation groan and travel in pain together?</hi> Rom. 8. 22.

Is their Sorrow turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Joy? Is the never-dying Worm to be hugg'd in your boſoms? and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire a thing to be play'd with? Oh! What do you mean who will not turn? Why do ye <hi>love Death?</hi> Prov. 8. <hi>ult.</hi> Why have ye the greateſt hand in your own ruine? Why are ye Devils to your ſelves? Why do ye deſperately ruſh on in Sin, and in the end throw your ſelves down into everlaſting Burnings?</p>
                  <p>7. To perſwade you to turn, Conſider, <hi>Converſion is a thing that never was, that never will be Repented of:</hi> The <hi>Prophane,</hi> in the <hi>other World at fartheſt,</hi> repent they did not <hi>turn at all;</hi> the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> repent they did not <hi>turn in truth;</hi> but ſincere Converts are glad they are ſo, and ſee good reaſon ſtill to continue ſo. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that <hi>the Gifts and Calling of God are without Repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29. when he effectually Calls any, and gives Converting Grace to them, it is ſuch a Gift that God never repents of beſtowing,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106042:68"/> neither ever does he take it quite away again: It is ſuch a Gift as Man never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents he has received, but has good cauſe to deſire that God would <hi>perfect what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him, and not forſake the work of his own hand,</hi> Pſal. 138. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. Converſion will make you <hi>great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in the places where you live:</hi> Converts are the <hi>Horſe-men and Chariots of Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as ſo many <hi>Princes</hi> they have <hi>power</hi> with the <hi>God of Iſrael. Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>Righteouſneſs exalts a Nation,</hi> Prov. 14. 34. The more <hi>Converts to Righteouſneſs</hi> there are, the more the <hi>Nation</hi> is <hi>beholding</hi> to them; but <hi>Obſtinate Sinners</hi> are not only their own, but the <hi>Nations greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> When Gods <hi>Anger</hi> has been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly provoked, ſo that he has doom'd a Nation to Deſtruction, Converſion even in this Caſe will do a kindneſs, <hi>Jer. 18. 7, 8. At what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil way, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them:</hi> Though <hi>England</hi> at this day, has <hi>many Enemies</hi> whoſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Policy is engaged againſt it; yet it is <hi>chiefly endanger'd</hi> by its <hi>ſins and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> A ſpeedy and general Converſion to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106042:69"/> God, would certainly be <hi>Englands</hi> ſecurity and eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>9. If you are Converts in truth, the <hi>News of it will be heard and known in Heaven, and occaſion Joy there;</hi> Luk. 15. 10. <hi>I ſay unto you, there is Joy in the preſence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God, over one Sinner that repenteth.</hi> The Angels did Sing at the <hi>Birth</hi> of a Saviour, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt, on Earth peace, good Will towards Men;</hi> and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the <hi>New-birth</hi> of all that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>10. Conſider the <hi>vaſt difference that is between the End of Converts, and thoſe that dye <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted.</hi> They that are <hi>wiſe,</hi> look not only at the <hi>begininng,</hi> but to the <hi>end</hi> of things, and they cannot think <hi>well</hi> of that which muſt needs <hi>end ill.</hi> And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Sinner dying,</hi> is one of the <hi>ſaddeſt ſpectacles</hi> in the World; he is leaving all his good things, all his Conſolation behind him; he and his hopes dye together, and <hi>whither</hi> does Death ſend him? to the <hi>Bar</hi> of an Holy and Righteous God. 'Tis a <hi>terrible Clauſe</hi> in the <hi>Statute</hi> of Dying, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. And how can the wicked Man, who <hi>would live,</hi> and <hi>did dye</hi> in his <hi>Sins,</hi> be able to <hi>ſtand</hi> in Judgment? Death comes to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted armed with a <hi>Sting;</hi> with a Sting
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106042:69"/> did I ſay? nay, the Stings are thouſands and millions, for <hi>every one</hi> of his Sins is a Sting in his Death, and his Sins being more in number than the Stars of Heaven, when Death ſeizes him, how <hi>many Stings will pierce him,</hi> and put him to Pain which will be Eternal? If he dyes <hi>ſtupid,</hi> 'tis ſo much the <hi>worſe;</hi> for Hell being not <hi>fear'd</hi> or <hi>thought of,</hi> when <hi>felt</hi> will be the more <hi>woful:</hi> If he dyes in <hi>horrour,</hi> alas, the greateſt Deſpair and Anguiſh on a <hi>Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,</hi> is no more to be compared with the <hi>Agonies</hi> of the <hi>Damned Spirits,</hi> than a <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper</hi> is to be compared with <hi>Thunder,</hi> or the <hi>ſmalleſt Spark of fire</hi> is to be compared with thoſe <hi>devouring Flames that in -66 did burn down</hi> London.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, how <hi>ends</hi> the Convert? Death is a fall from every thing but Grace, and Grace then is perfected in Glory: The <hi>end</hi> of the upright and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Convert is <hi>Peace,</hi> Pſal. 37. 37. and a peaceful Death is the forerunner of an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Rest:</hi> If he ſhould dye in a Cloud, he would ſhine not at all the leſs bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in another World; all ſin, and fears, and tears will be gone, as ſoon as he enters into Heavens door, and ſees his Lord there: If he ſets, as the Sun in the cleareſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers evening, his Death is encouraging to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106042:70"/> others, comfortable to himſelf, but ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand times more Comfort will he preſently have, as ſoon as ever he is got out of, and is <hi>abſent from the body, and is preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 8.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the Motives to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; <hi>And now for ſhame be ſilent, all tongues that talk against turning to God! Apoſtate Angels, be for ever mute! what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries and lying Spirits are ye, in diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Man from Converſion, and in aſſerting, that though he turn not, he ſhall not ſurely dye? And Carnal Reaſon, confeſs thy ſelf quite baffled with ſtrength of Argument, and that not one word more of good ſenſe can be ſpoken againſt the Sinners Converſion, which is ſo much for his Interest both in time and to eternity.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> V. Of Direction, how <hi>Sinners may become true and thorough Converts:</hi> It great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns you to be ſincere in turning, for in this matter you have <hi>chiefly</hi> to do with <hi>God himſelf,</hi> who can't be deceived with the faireſt ſhews, but underſtands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the moſt ſecret thoughts, inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and purpoſes of the Hearts of Men; every upright Heart is open to him, and he <hi>takes Pleaſure in the uprightneſs</hi> which himſelf has wrought. And if there be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106042:70"/> nothing but Hypocriſie under the greateſt Profeſſion, that Hypocriſie is both obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abhorred: Any thing ſhort of true and thorough Converſion, will be a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Cheating of your ſelves;</hi> therefore, that you may be Converts indeed, I ſhall give you theſe Directions.</p>
                  <p>1. Let <hi>ſpiritual Wiſdom and Knowledge be valued, as that which is of great price and uſefulneſs:</hi> He that is indeed a Convert, is <hi>called out of darkneſs into marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. In this <hi>Verſe</hi> where my Text lies, <hi>Converting the Soul</hi> and <hi>making Wiſe the Simple</hi> are joyn'd together, the one is neceſſary and ſubſervient to the other. That <hi>Devotion</hi> of which <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the <hi>Mother,</hi> is indeed a following of blind and deluded, or crafty and deluding Guides; but a turning to, and a following of God, it is not.</p>
                  <p>Be well Catechized and Inſtructed in the Principles of the Scripture-doctrine; let a true Light be ſet up in your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. The Mind is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the leading Faculty, 'tis needful it be well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. In the firſt Creation, when <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs covered the face of the deep, God ſaid, let there be Light, and there was Light,</hi> Gen. 1. 2, 3. and thus it is in the new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Converſion, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. God who
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106042:71"/> commanded the Light to ſhine out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined into our Hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Christ.</hi> Search for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scripture, as you would ſearch for Silver or hid Treaſure, and look up to Heaven for light and ability to underſtand it, that you may know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>God in him;</hi> and what you are to <hi>believe, deſire</hi> and <hi>do</hi> in order to your Happineſs. You can't be made wiſe to Salvation, unleſs you are firſt made wiſe to Converſion.</p>
                  <p>And as you are <hi>to acquaint</hi> your ſelves with, ſo you are <hi>firmly to aſſent</hi> to the Doctrine revealed in the Word of God; and the more ſtrongly you credit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Word ſayes, the more powerful influence will this Faith have upon your Conſcience, Will and Life. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> is the root of defection and <hi>departing from the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> Heb. 3. 12. If the <hi>arm of the Lord be revealed,</hi> his Power ſhewn forth, and cauſe the <hi>report</hi> of the Word, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings of it, to be <hi>indeed believed,</hi> this will have a <hi>mighty efficacy</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Souls <hi>return to God again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That you may become true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, be <hi>ſenſible that all Mankind are fallen by Iniquity,</hi> and are eſtranged from God, and <hi>you in particular are by Nature far off
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106042:71"/> from Him.</hi> The Lord indeed made <hi>Man upright, but he has ſought out many Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. <hi>ult.</hi> New wayes he thought to have found of being higher and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but while through the ſubtilty of the old Serpent, he catcht at a ſhadow, he loſt the ſubſtance, and became both fooliſh and miſerable. <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Man, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the humane Nature, and as thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted you partake of it, ſo that you are <hi>by Nature Children of Wrath;</hi> your Hearts are deſperately wicked, dangerouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and returning to God is that which they have a ſtrange and ſtrong antipathy againſt: The more you are ſenſible that your Hearts are thus depraved and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Perceiving and being burthen'd with a Diſtemper, is a good ſtep towards a Cure, eſpecially if an able Phyſician is ready to heal any that will but make uſe of him. A right ſenſe that Sin has ſet you at a diſtance from God, and that thoſe <hi>who are far from him ſhall periſh,</hi> Pſal. 37. 27. will have a mighty tendency to your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought nigh to him, by the Blood and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus: And truly

                  </p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:106042:72"/>
                  <p>In true Humiliation there is a mixture of <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>ſhame,</hi> and upon theſe does follow holy <hi>anger and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Look up to Heaven, behold the <hi>great and glorious God againſt whom</hi> every one of <hi>your</hi> Sins have been committed.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let your <hi>Sorrow</hi> expreſs it ſelf freely and abundantly in <hi>remembrance of your evil wayes.</hi> Sin is the <hi>only evil</hi> in Gods eyes, and the <hi>

Every Sin has given you a <hi>Wound,</hi> and as Sins Wounds are the worſt, ſo they ſhould be moſt grievous: Lament when you ſee in what a woful plight you are. The ſad effects of Sin the whole man over, the Prophet emphatically ſets forth, <hi>Iſa. 1. 5, 6. The whole Head is ſick, the whole Heart is faint; from the ſole of the foot even to the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds, bruiſes and putrifying ſores; they have not been cloſed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oyntment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſhould you not be aſhamed of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106042:73"/> your own folly in being ſuch enemies to your ſelves? your Pollutions, your Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is really of your ſelves; <hi>Guilt</hi> ſhould make you bluſh, and becauſe Sin has <hi>ſtript you naked</hi> and bare of every thing that's good and beautiful: Oh what a loathſome Leproſie is apparent in all your Parts and Powers! your <hi>fouleſt ſpots</hi> are <hi>open</hi> to <hi>Gods eye,</hi> well therefore you may be cover'd with Confuſion; and that which ſtill ſhould make you more confounded, is your <hi>baſe ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;</hi> you have <hi>deſpiſed riches of goodneſs,</hi> you have abuſed Mercy and Grace, and when a Cure has been offered in the Goſpel you <hi>would not be healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be therefore truly angry at your ſelves. Let your Indignation and hatred ſpend it ſelf on your iniquities, be revenged upon them, that they being mortified and <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> you may not <hi>dye in</hi> them and <hi>for</hi> them: Humiliation is indeed grievous to Nature, but friendly to Grace. The more Humiliation <hi>Ploughs up the Fallow ground,</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> commonly are brought forth in <hi>greater Plenty.</hi>
                  </p>

The Saints of old that were <hi>in Heaven</hi> before the Son of God was manifeſted in the Fleſh, as well as thoſe that went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterward, were all brought <hi>nigh to God by the Blood of his Croſs,</hi> Col. 1. 20.</p>
                  <p>You cannot <hi>know,</hi> and turn to the <hi>only true God,</hi> ſo as to be received by him, unleſs you know and receive <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom he has ſent.</hi> But if you behold God in Chriſt, unbelief appears unreaſonable, deſpair is a monſtrous abſurdity: You may perceive Love in the Lords looks, his Juſtice fully ſatisfied, his Anger all gone, his Repentings kindled, his Bowels yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and you cannot ſo much <hi>deſire</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as He <hi>delights</hi> in ſhewing it. The true Convert to God <hi>muſt</hi> be a <hi>Believer</hi> in Juſus, who is <hi>the way</hi> to the Father: As <hi>God will not</hi> draw nigh to Man, ſo <hi>Man cannot</hi> draw nigh to God any <hi>other way.</hi>

Adams</hi> Body was <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Duſt</hi> of the Ground, but was a <hi>lifeleſs Corps,</hi> till God <hi>breathed into it the Breath of Life.</hi> Till the Spirit of Life en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into you, you are without Life or Motion towards God, therefore with all ſeriouſneſs ask the Spirit: You come to God <hi>through the Son,</hi> as the Mediator that procures acceſs and opens the way, but 'tis <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> as by Him who both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines and ſtrengthens you to come to Him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſe of the Spirit is of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent date, implied in the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and very frequently expreſſed: Under the New Teſtament Diſpenſation, a more plentiful effuſion of the Spirit is Promiſed. <hi>Parents that are evil,</hi> if their <hi>Children ask bread will not give them a ſtone</hi> to hurt them, nor inſtead of a <hi>Fiſh,</hi> a <hi>Serpent</hi> to ſting them: And if they give good gifts to their Children, <hi>much more will the Father in Heaven give his Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> There is hardly a more encouraging Word to Sinners in the whole Bible, if they <hi>are inclined,</hi> or <hi>would be</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to have the Spirit given them: And if the Holy Spirit be given you, you will have Light, and Life and Liberty.

                  </p>
                  <p>Be never ſatisfied, till you perceive that God has <hi>your love,</hi> which is indeed the <hi>leading</hi> and <hi>commanding Affection.</hi> If Sin, if Mammons Pleaſures and Wealth have ſtill your love, your profeſſing your ſelves Converts, is all but <hi>feigned kindneſs,</hi> and you <hi>provoke the Lord to jealouſiè:</hi> Give unto God your <hi>Love</hi> which he <hi>calls for,</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Commandment; or

Can the Heart be ſaid to be turned to God, which is leaſt inclined towards him, and moſt ſtrongly and reſolvedly bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sin and Vanity?

                  <p>Though I have ſpoken a great deal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to ſhew who are Converted, yet I ſhall add theſe Signs following.</p>
                  <p>1. Converts <hi>chuſe God for their Portron; rather than the World:</hi> Thou art <hi>my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, O Lord, I have ſaid I will keep thy Word;</hi> this was a Converts Language, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 57. So <hi>Lam. 3. 24. The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him.</hi> A Converted Soul cannot be ſatiated with Vanity, no ſufficiency is enough for it but Gods Alſufficiency.</p>
                  <p>2. Converts <hi>chuſe Christ for their Ruler, rather than Sin;</hi> they are weary of <hi>Sins Dominion,</hi> as well as afraid of its <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and they conſent that Sin ſhould no longer reign in them; but they are <hi>willing</hi> to be the Lords <hi>in the day of his Power, Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. they yield hearty Obedience to his Commands, and are ſorry they can't, and wiſh they <hi>could</hi> yield better.

                  <p>3. Converts <hi>chuſe Saints for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, rather than the VVicked: David</hi>

Though there is a <hi>viciſſitude</hi> between <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night,</hi> between <hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> yet the <hi>God of Nature</hi> changes not, and the <hi>God of Grace</hi> is <hi>Immutable,</hi> and his <hi>Heart</hi> is ſtill on Converts, though they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106042:82"/> ſometimes <hi>walk in Darkneſs,</hi> and ſee not the <hi>Light</hi> of his bleſſed <hi>Countenance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Converts are <hi>wiſe Builders, for they have a ſure foundation, and ſhall never be confounded.</hi> The <hi>Blood</hi> of Jeſus, which is the Blood of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>riches of the Grace</hi> of God in him, are the foundation of their Faith and Hope: <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Rock</hi> upon which the Church, and every true Member of it, is built; and thoſe who while Militant, are thus fortified and ſecured, ſhall certainly at laſt triumph over the World and Sin, and <hi>the gates of Hell:</hi> The Convert has <hi>caſt anchor within the Vail,</hi> Heb. 6. 19. Chriſt is <hi>his Hope, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 1. His Hope of Pardon, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace, and future Glory. If Chriſt <hi>were not,</hi> or were not <hi>his,</hi> he would be <hi>all Deſpair;</hi> but Chriſt having done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and Purchaſed both him and ſo much for him, he <hi>does abound in Hope,</hi> by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>The Converts Hope diſtinguiſhes it ſelf from the preſumptuous Expectation of the Hypocrite; for when he <hi>Hopes for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he <hi>keeps the Commands of God,</hi> Pſal. 119. 166. In this ſenſe he is a wiſe Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for his Faith is <hi>effectual</hi> to good Works, his Hope makes <hi>him patiently continue in well, doing:</hi> Thoſe words are very encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106042:83"/> to the obedient Convert, <hi>Mat. 7. 24, 25. Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe man, who built his Houſe upon a rock; and the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe; and it ſelf not, ſor it was founded upon a rock.</hi> They build well and wiſely indeed, <hi>who lay up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal Life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 19.</p>
                  <p>3. Converts are made <hi>better by the good things</hi> of this World, and <hi>the evils</hi> they meet with <hi>work together for their good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. If they <hi>have the Creatures</hi> in ſome Plenty and abundance, they have <hi>God with them;</hi> if they are deprived of them, they have <hi>God without them,</hi> and ſo are ſtill <hi>well,</hi> and have enough in him. No diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations fall wrong to the Convert, he can fly with any wings, he can fail with any wind; nay, <hi>under water</hi> he can <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>dive,</hi> and <hi>ſwim</hi> towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is indeed <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>4. Converts have <hi>the Ordinances of God,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106042:83"/> and the means of Grace bleſſed to them.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>ſavour of Life unto Life</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. The <hi>Prayers</hi> they ſend to Heaven, come back agian with <hi>rich returns</hi> of <hi>Mercy and Grace:</hi> Sacrament dayes are dayes of <hi>Strength,</hi> and oftentimes of <hi>Solace;</hi> and not only <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Preſent</hi> Benefits are exhibited to them, but an <hi>Eternal Inheritance</hi> is alſo <hi>made over,</hi> under the <hi>broad Seal</hi> of Heaven, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are <hi>Sealed by the Spirit unto the day of Redemption,</hi> Eph. 5. 30. <hi>David</hi> that reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Benefit</hi> by Ordinances, pronounces the <hi>Tabernacles of God amiable,</hi> Pſal. 84. 1. <hi>A day in his Courts better than a thouſand.</hi> It was the <hi>one thing</hi> he deſired, that he <hi>might dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the dayes of his Life,</hi> that he might <hi>ſee his Beauty, Power and Glory,</hi> and <hi>taſte his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> there. That Noble Marqueſs, <hi>Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus Caracciolus,</hi> need not have been <hi>preſent</hi> at a <hi>falſe worſhip;</hi> he might have had the <hi>Liberty</hi> of Religion in his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> yet he left all, that he might enjoy <hi>pure publick Ordinances:</hi> Certainly he found that of <hi>Grace,</hi> that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them, as was much more valuable to him than all his <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Plentiful Eſtate,</hi> which is one of the <hi>chief Flowers</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Garden of the World.</hi>

                  <p>5. God is <hi>turned unto theſe true Converts that are turned to him;</hi> and will <hi>never turn away from them to do them good,</hi> and to <hi>keep them good,</hi> and upright before Him. Regeneration and Converſion is a great Fruit and effect of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. Believers are ſaid to be <hi>begotten again to a lively hope by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> And as Chriſt <hi>being raiſed from the dead dieth no more, Death hath no more Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over him,</hi> Rom. 6. 9. ſo they who by Converting Grace are made ſpiritually a live, ſhall never totally relapſe under the Dominion of Sin, nor become again dead in Treſpaſſes. That God who has <hi>called</hi> theſe Converts is <hi>faithful,</hi> and therefore, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>he will preſerve their whole Spirits and Souls and Bodies blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 23, 24. The Lord turns to them that are turned, <hi>Zech. 1. 3. Turn to me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and I will turn to you, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> he turns his <hi>Eye,</hi> his <hi>Face,</hi> his <hi>Ear,</hi> his <hi>Heart,</hi> his <hi>Hand</hi> towards them <hi>for good.</hi> And he has ſaid he <hi>will never leave them nor forſake them,</hi> neither ſhall <hi>they leave</hi> nor <hi>forſake him;</hi> for he will eſtabliſh them with his <hi>Free Spirit,</hi> he will <hi>uphold them with the right
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106042:84"/> hand of his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Oh Happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, who have <hi>Glory</hi> promiſed upon their Perſeverance! and have <hi>Strengthning Grace</hi> Promiſed to make them perſevere unto the end!</p>
                  <p>6. Converſion will <hi>end in Coronation.</hi> All Converts are by Adoption the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God, heirs</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and ſhall <hi>for ever wear a Crown of Life.</hi> Though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens knew ſomething of future Rewards and Puniſhments, yet their Apprehenſions of theſe were low and unſuitable.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> VII. Of <hi>Counſel</hi> unto them that are Converted; and my Advice ſhall be in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. Thankfully <hi>admire the Grace of God</hi> which has Converted you: The <hi>beſt</hi> thing in <hi>this World,</hi> which is <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in the <hi>World to come,</hi> certainly do well <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> your thanks. Sin has made you <hi>leſs than the leaſt of Mercies,</hi> by Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you come to partake of the <hi>greateſt:</hi> Chriſt is formed in you, and you are made New Creatures, that a New Song ſhould be in your Mouths, and that you ſhould <hi>ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who has called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. Let every Convert ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and admiring, Praiſe, and ſay, <hi>How
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106042:86"/> much has God done for me!</hi> and how has he done that for <hi>me,</hi> which he has not done for <hi>thouſands</hi> and <hi>millions</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> in the very <hi>Church,</hi> who are <hi>let alone</hi> to live and dye in Sin, and to damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ever!</p>
                  <p>2. Labour to be <hi>more thoroughly Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> Pray for this, that God would ſtill turn you more and more unto himſelf; follow on to know him, follow harder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and ſtrive ſtill more to pleaſe him; 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 1. Furthermore then we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you Brethren, and exhort you by our Lord Jeſus, that as ye have received, how ye ought to walk and to pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more:</hi> The more fully you turn, the more you pleaſe him, and to pleaſe him will be pleaſant to you: The nearer you come to God, the ſafer you will be under his ſhadow, the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently will you ſee, and the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly will you taſte his goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>3. Do nothing <hi>unbecoming Converts:</hi> Think often with your ſelves <hi>whoſe</hi> you are, and what a Price was pay'd to <hi>redeem you from all Iniquity,</hi> and to make you <hi>Zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. Reckon it <hi>bruitiſh</hi> to be Intemperate and Unclean, <hi>baſe</hi> to be Covetous, and Earthly-minded, <hi>helliſh</hi> to be Malicious, Envious and Proud. Be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106042:86"/> Patient under Gods Corrections, under In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries from Man: Let your Tongues be true and kind, your Hands merciful and juſt, in your Morals be of great exactneſs: Divine Morality! without thee Religion is a vain ſhew, holy Duties are but loſt labour, and Confidence that all is well is but ſelf-deceiving: What <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Vertue,</hi> may be uſed concerning Faith, <hi>O miſerable Faith, without moral Honeſty thou art nothing elſe but an empty Name!</hi> Take heed of falls, eſpecially great ones, after Converſion, leaſt you wound both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion, and go ſmarting and groaning to your Graves.</p>
                  <p>4. Pity the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted about you:</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery moves Bowels, and ſtirs up Mercy; who more miſerable than Sinners, who are at a diſtance from God, and under his Wrath; and who are ſo far from fearing and turning, that they are ſtill running farther from him, and provoking him to fiercer indignation? Compaſſionate theſe, Counſel theſe, Pray for theſe, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, though they are and will be <hi>without the Word,</hi> to <hi>win them</hi> by a wiſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>Love,</hi> and by a <hi>well-ordered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1. Let not your Bowels be ſtraitned, but Pray for the <hi>Worlds</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God, that he would return to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106042:87"/> this Earth, which for Sin he has ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſaken, and that he would <hi>turn the VVorld</hi> into a <hi>New One,</hi> wherein <hi>may dwell Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Be ſure <hi>to Love all true Converts:</hi> Love them all, becauſe <hi>God loves</hi> them, and love <hi>what you ſee of God</hi> in them: The Image of God is ſo excellent, that in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhines, it ought with pure affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be owned and reſpected. Converts I grant may <hi>differ</hi> in many things, but they <hi>agree in the main;</hi> all of them <hi>believe in Jeſus,</hi> all of them <hi>turn to God,</hi> all of them endeavour to <hi>Glorifie him</hi> here on Earth, and all of them are <hi>bound for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> And <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Agreement</hi> thus far; is a ſtrong reaſon for <hi>Catholick and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Charity.</hi> All Converts, of <hi>what Perſwaſion</hi> ſoever, of what <hi>Nation</hi> ſoever, of what <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> ſoever in this World; they are all adopted by <hi>one Father,</hi> all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by <hi>one Christ Jeſus,</hi> all eſpouſed to <hi>one Husband,</hi> all members of <hi>one Body,</hi> all enlivened by <hi>one Spirit,</hi> and ſhall all meet at laſt in <hi>one Heaven,</hi> where they ſhall perfectly be joyned together in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and in Love; and this ſhould ſtrongly move and perſwade unto Unity and Love at preſent.</p>
                  <p>6. Laſtly, (and ſo I conclude this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,)
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106042:87"/> you that are Coverts, <hi>ſee that you abide with God, and be ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> they that <hi>totally,</hi> and <hi>finally depart</hi> from God, never were <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>fully turned</hi> to him. Let your Perſeverance be an evident Demonſtration, to prove the truth of your Converſation; let not the <hi>hardeſt labour,</hi> the <hi>hotteſt ſervice,</hi> that you may be put upon, the <hi>greateſt ſufferings</hi> that you may be expoſed to, in the <hi>leaſt diſcourage</hi> you, for God doth not require that you ſhould do, or that you ſhould ſuffer any thing for him, but only <hi>by the ſtrength</hi> that he himſelf hath promiſed, and doth intend to give. All you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts have <hi>done well</hi> in turning to God, <hi>do better</hi> in following hard after him; and <hi>beſt of all</hi> in finiſhing your courſe, that you may get the Crown of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Let your <hi>Faith</hi> be firm, like to the <hi>Rock</hi> it is founded upon; let your <hi>hope</hi> be ſtedfaſt. Be <hi>rooted, and grounded in your love;</hi> and let your hearts be ſo <hi>united to fear the name of God,</hi> Pſal. 86. 11. that it may be as poſſible to <hi>hinder the Sun</hi> from riſing, as to hinder you from <hi>ſhining like lights in the World.</hi> That it may be as poſſible to cauſe the <hi>Moon and Stars</hi> to ceaſe their wonted courſes, as to turn
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106042:88"/> you out of the way of Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That it may be as poſſible to alter the Ordinances of Heaven, as to make you neglect Heaven, and become again earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I done with the firſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that I raiſed from the words, which I have been large upon: <hi>That Converſion, is of abſolute neceſſity, and the great thing that God requires of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. I proceed unto the ſecond Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that I raiſed from the words, and that is this. <hi>Converſion is then ſincere, when the ſoul is Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is the chief ſubject of Sin. It is the Soul that uſes, or rather abuſes the members of the Body, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs. The Beaſts that have no rational Soul, are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of committing Iniquity; and as the Soul is the chief ſubject of Sin, ſo it is the chief ſubject of <hi>Converting Grace;</hi> if this be not turned, really there is no true turning unto God. God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and he <hi>weighs the Spirits of Men;</hi> and he doth chiefly <hi>require the Heart and Spirit,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. and accordingly the Convert with <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal. 25. 1. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee; O Lord, do I lift up my Soul.</hi> And Pſal. 119.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106042:88"/> 129. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are wonderful, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Soul keep them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling this Doctrine,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I am to ſhew you, when the <hi>Soul may</hi> be ſaid to be <hi>Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To prove, that till the Soul is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; <hi>Converſion is not ſincere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To demonſtrate the <hi>neceſſity of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to God with the <hi>very Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the laſt place, <hi>to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I am to tell you, when <hi>the Soul</hi> may be ſaid <hi>truly to be Converted;</hi> the opening of this, is the chief thing that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. When the Soul is Converted, there is <hi>a marvellous Light that ſhines into the Mind.</hi> The Tree of <hi>Knowledge</hi> was <hi>ſo</hi> called, becauſe it was a Tree of <hi>Tryal;</hi> whether Man would perſevere in goodneſs; or whether he would be tempted, and <hi>drawn away to evil:</hi> but when this Tree was once taſted, Man preſently <hi>fell under the power of darkneſs.</hi> The eyes of all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are blind, <hi>till enlightned by the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation,</hi> Eph. 1. 17, 18. All the Stars that are in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot make day without the Sun; and all the works that God hath wrought, all the words that he hath ſpoken, cannot of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106042:89"/> themſelves enlighten the mind of Man without the Spirit of God. It is <hi>He</hi> that takes off the Vail, and cauſes the Light to ſhine upon, and into the very Soul.</p>
                  <p>This Light <hi>makes things manifeſt,</hi> Eph. 5. 13. <hi>For all things that are reproved are made manifeſt by the light, for whatſoever doth make manifeſt is light.</hi> This Light that ſhines into a Converted Soul, doth diſcover <hi>Sin;</hi> it ſhews the filth, the ſpots, the ſting, the poyſon, the death, the wrath, the Hell, that is in Sin, or is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. It doth diſcover the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, in hiding its own bad nature, and the dreadful conſequences that follow upon it.</p>
                  <p>And as this Light doth make ſin mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, ſo it doth diſcover <hi>Chriſt</hi> too; the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of his juſtifying Righteouſneſs, the excellency of his ſanctifying Grace: and how to turn to God, is, of miſerable to become truly bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>This Light alſo is <hi>directing.</hi> It directs what Converts muſt do that they may be ſaved. It ſhews them the End, and the proper Means for the attaining of that End. It leads them out of the broad way, and from all the ſnares, and ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks, and the precipices that are there
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106042:89"/> and it leads them into <hi>the way that is everlaſting,</hi> Pſal. 139. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, This Light that ſhines into the Converted Soul, hath <hi>Heat and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence;</hi> like the Light of the Sun in the Spring-ſeaſon, that cauſeth the Trees and Plants to be flouriſhing, and to be fruitful. The Light of the Converts, hath a mighty influence upon them. The things that are <hi>freely given of God,</hi> are <hi>ſo</hi> ſeen, as that the heart is taken with them, as the <hi>principal things</hi> of all; and undervalues other things in compariſon of thoſe. Thus the <hi>wiſe Merchant</hi> that ſought <hi>goodly Pearls,</hi> when he had found <hi>one Pearl of great price,</hi> he <hi>went and ſold all that he had, and bought it,</hi> Matth. 13. 46.</p>
                  <p>2. When the Soul is Converted, the <hi>Judgment is rectified.</hi> The Judgment of the natural Man is wofully perverted. He judges aright of nothing, he judges amiſs of every thing: <hi>Wo</hi> to him, he <hi>calls evil good, and good evil; he puts darkneſs for Light, and Light for darkneſs; bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter;</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 20. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God he ealls by the Name of <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> and the <hi>folly</hi> of the <hi>VVorld,</hi> he will needs have to be the <hi>ſhrewdeſt and beſt ſort of wiſdom.</hi> He <hi>errs</hi> on <hi>both hands,</hi> valuing what is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106042:90"/> vile, and ſleighting what is excellent.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. telleth us, That he that is <hi>ſpiritual judgeth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no Man.</hi> The Convert hath a faculty of <hi>ſpiritual diſcerning,</hi> and can paſs a right judgment upon things. One Angel can ſee another, though the bodily Eye can ſee neither. One that is a Convert, having a ſpiritual faculty of diſcerning, can ſee the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſpiritual things, which the natural Man cannot behold. And when it is ſaid, that the Spiritual <hi>Man is judged of no Man,</hi> the meaning is this; that no natural Man is a <hi>competent judge</hi> concerning him. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, he may; as if he were regardleſs of, and <hi>beſide</hi> himſelf, but really this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is without reaſon. Not judging, but miſsjudging this is to be called.</p>
                  <p>The Converts judgment is very ſound, he takes the right ballance, even thoſe of the Sanctuary, to weigh all things in. He compares <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Creature</hi> together, the <hi>righteouſneſs and ſtrength</hi> of Man, and the <hi>righteouſneſs and ſtrength</hi> of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; things <hi>temporal,</hi> and things <hi>eternal</hi> together; and weighing theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the difference between them is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. He writes <hi>Takel</hi> upon what is <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and upon what is <hi>Mans;</hi> and the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106042:90"/> weightieſt and moſt excellent things he doth approve as ſuch; eſpecially a far <hi>more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17.</p>
                  <p>And as the Converts Judgment is ſound, ſo let me tell you, it is <hi>very grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> in propounding what is good unto the <hi>Will.</hi> It is deliberate in its <hi>determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> what is good; and then with greateſt evidence and ſtrength of Reaſon, nay, with Demonſtration of the Spirit, it urges the Soul, that this which is ſo good may be followed and embraced. My beloved, a Judgment thus rectified, and <hi>ſet right,</hi> it is one of the <hi>greateſt Bleſſings</hi> from Heaven, and comes down <hi>from the Father of Lights,</hi> who manifeſts himſelf to be the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> in beſtowing ſuch a Gift. Now the Soul is Light when the Judgment is rectified, and the whole Man is under bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conduct; and this Light proves Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Defence againſt the <hi>Works of Darkneſs: Rom. 13. 12, 13, 14. Let us caſt off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armour of light: Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wantonneſs, not in strife and envying, but put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the lusts thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:106042:91"/>
                  <p>3. When the Soul is converted, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is made very faithful, and very tender.</hi> The Soul of Man is endued with a Power of Self-reflection; it can with a great deal of delight take notice of what <hi>of God,</hi> and what <hi>of good</hi> is in it ſelf; and it can ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly <hi>recoyl</hi> upon it ſelf, and prove a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſher, at the commiſſion of what is <hi>evil.</hi> The Conſcience of an unconverted Sinner, is uſually in a dead ſleep. How many ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſciences are here, God awaken them to day: Uſually the Conſcience of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Sinner is in a dead ſleep. He takes little or no notice at all of that God that is by him, of his Preſence, of the Purity of his Law, and of the Sinners obligation to obey it. And Conſcience being thus aſleep, <hi>talks in its ſleep;</hi> and what doth it talk? in its ſleep it doth <hi>ſay, Peace,</hi> and it doth <hi>dream of Safety;</hi> and thus it goes on crying Peace, and dreaming of Safety, untill <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain destruction</hi> doth <hi>prove</hi> that Peace and that Safety to be nothing elſe but a meer <hi>deluſion. 1 Theſſ. 5. 3. When men ſhall ſay, Peace and Safety, then ſuddain destruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them as travel upon a woman with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Convert, his Conſcience is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened; it is awakened ſo thoroughly, that it keeps more or leſs <hi>awake ever after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:106042:91"/>
                  <p>The Conſcience doth <hi>underſtand</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> that it hath <hi>from</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>And it doth <hi>improve</hi> that Authority <hi>for</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>The Conſcience of a Convert doth <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> the Authority that it hath <hi>from</hi> God. The God of Heaven hath allowed the Conſcience a <hi>Negative Voice.</hi> To ſin contrary to the Light, and to the Dictates of Conſcience, it is to ſin with a great Aggravation, and it is to incurr great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 20. If our <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things.</hi> Nay, ſuppoſing that Conſcience doth but <hi>doubt</hi> concerning an Action, that Action muſt not be ventured upon untill Conſcience be <hi>fully ſatisfied</hi> about it, <hi>Rom. 14. ult. He that doubts</hi> of the lawfulneſs of a Meat, is damned if he eats, becauſe <hi>he eateth not of Faith;</hi> that is, being not fully perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of what he eats; he eats not of Faith, and that which is <hi>not of Faith, is ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as Conſcience knows the Authority it hath of God, ſo it doth <hi>improve</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe this Authority that it hath from God, for Him. The Converts Conſcience urges that the Will of God may be done ſtill, tho' it never ſo much thwarts the inclination and grain of mans; it urges that God may
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106042:92"/> be alwayes pleaſed, whoever is offended, and herein it does conſult the Converts trueſt Intereſt. The ſharper the Sight, the clearer the Light, the greater the force of Conſcience is, there will be a departing from evil with the greater fear, and care, and hatred, and there will be a doing of good with the greater diligence, exactneſs and perſeverance; and all this is for the good of Converts in more Worlds than one. <hi>Pſal. 37. 27. Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. When the Soul is Converted, <hi>the Thoughts have not a lawleſs Liberty allowed them, but there is a Conflict with them, and great care to govern them well.</hi> The Mind of Man is a buſie and an Active thing, thoughts are continually iſſuing from it, as Sparks from a Furnace, or Waters from a Fountain; and naturally <hi>all</hi> theſe are <hi>evil, Gen. 6. 5. God ſaw that the wickedneſs of Man was great upon the Earth, and every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> When the Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the nature of the Thoughts is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; <hi>vain and ſinful thoughts</hi> preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>burthenſome.</hi> The Heart is made <hi>new,</hi> and a <hi>new heart</hi> will have <hi>new kind</hi> of <hi>thoughts.</hi> The thoughts will be pure and clean, if the Heart be ſanctified and cleanſed. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:106042:92"/> did ſhew her ſelf a Stranger to Converſion, that ſhe was ſtill indeed in her wickedneſs, as long as ſinful and vain thoughts had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment given to them; <hi>Jer. 4. 14. O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved, how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A converted Soul may be likened unto a Houſe that formerly had very bad, but now hath other and better Inhabitants. The Hectors, the Ranters, the Swearers, the Whoremongers, the Drunkards; they come and knock at the Door of this Houſe, and ſay, that <hi>formerly none were more welcome there than themſelves;</hi> but the door is kept faſt lockt, bolted, barr'd againſt them; and the anſwer is, that there is no room for ſuch as they. The Houſe hath now another owner, that don't like ſuch company, but another, a better ſort of Society. Thus it is with the Heart of the Convert; proud, luſtfull, covetous, malicious, revengefull thoughts <hi>plead</hi> for <hi>admiſſion;</hi> and ſay <hi>we uſed to be very welcome,</hi> and formerly there was a great deal of pleaſure, and delight taken <hi>in us,</hi> and muſt we now be turned out of doors? The anſwer is, the Heart hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Inhabitant:</hi> Sin dwelt there before, and then ſinful thoughts were welcom thoughts; Ay, but now Grace <hi>reigns there,</hi> therefore
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106042:93"/> theſe ſinful Thoughts as faſt as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Croud in, there are endeavours uſed to extrude them.</p>
                  <p>And as ſinful thoughts are burthenſome to a Converted Soul, ſo <hi>good thoughts</hi> are <hi>welcome gueſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Indulge Hoſpitio cauſaſque innecte morandi.</q>
                  <p>A Converted Soul Indulges to ſuch Thoughts, and earneſtly deſires their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant abode and ſtay. The Convert is truly troubled that he can <hi>hardly joyn three or four good thoughts together without ſome Interruption:</hi> The Convert wiſhes, that God were more, and with more delight his Meditation; and that his Law were meditated on, and delighted in as well as himſelf. Saith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. <hi>My Meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. It is ſaid of the bleſſed man, <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and Night.</hi> And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert whoſe Soul is indeed turned unto God, he ſpeaks thus; ſuch and ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful let my thoughts ever be.</p>
                  <p>5. When the Soul is Converted there is <hi>a Conformity</hi> of <hi>the Will of man, unto the Holy and bleſſed Will of God.</hi> This was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106042:93"/> the ground of the <hi>firſt controverſie</hi> between the Lord and thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> that revolted from him; they would needs <hi>oppoſe their wills</hi> to his: God would have them to keep <hi>humble,</hi> their Wills were to become <hi>proud,</hi> and pride was both the <hi>fault</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 6. <hi>Not a Novice, leſt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> God would have theſe Angels to abide <hi>in Truth,</hi> but their <hi>will</hi> was to let go <hi>their Primitive Integrity,</hi> and they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe and rebellious Spirits: And the <hi>natural man</hi> is too much like theſe <hi>evil Angels.</hi> God calls, but man will not hear; God commands, but man will not obey; and in ſome ſort evil men <hi>out-do</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels; becauſe when God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> and to <hi>cure,</hi> and to <hi>ſave</hi> the Children of men, they <hi>chuſe death</hi> and <hi>damning,</hi> rather than they will <hi>conſent</hi> to be healed. But when the Soul is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the <hi>Will</hi> is changed; and indeed the great <hi>turning change</hi> is <hi>here:</hi> In the Will of man there is the great turning change wrought; as long as <hi>that</hi> remains <hi>perverſe,</hi> and ſtubborn, and refractory, to be ſure there is nothing of Converting Grace; and when once the <hi>Will</hi> is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and <hi>ſet right,</hi> and <hi>inclined ſteddily</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106042:94"/> God, all <hi>remaining infirmities</hi> and the <hi>Truth of Grace,</hi> may very well ſtand together.</p>
                  <p>There are theſe three things that the Will of the Convert doth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It doth <hi>make choice</hi> of that which God propounds as moſt <hi>eligible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>Subject unto Gods Laws,</hi> and Commandments.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It <hi>ſubmits to Correction and the Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Will of the Convert makes choice of that which God propounds as moſt eligible; and above all it makes choice of <hi>God himſelf.</hi> It is taken with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Riches of his Grace:</hi> It is taken with <hi>his Wiſdom, Truth, Faithfulneſs; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs,</hi> and <hi>Eternity.</hi> To enjoy the higheſt and chiefeſt good, and to enjoy this good for ever, and for ever: What is <hi>more,</hi> what is <hi>ſo</hi> worthy to be choſen? The bent of <hi>Davids</hi> Will was thus towards God when he ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 42. 2. My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God?</hi> and though <hi>David</hi> was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a <hi>Throne,</hi> yet that doth not <hi>divert</hi> him from ſeeking after God, and ſaying to him, <hi>O when wilt thou come to me!</hi> Pſal. 101. 2. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely, in a perfect way, O when wilt thou come to me!
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106042:94"/> I will walk within my houſe with a perfect Heart.</hi> Though my Houſe be a Palace, and though my Chair be a Throne; I ſhall be uneaſie in my Seat, I ſhall look upon my Crown as uncomfortable, unleſs I have thy Preſence in this Palace of mine: and therefore, O when wilt thou come unto me!</p>
                  <p>The Converted Soul <hi>refuſes,</hi> what God informs it is evil; what God informs it is abominable; and Sin doth very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Name of Abomination: The Converted Soul doth ſleight that, which the <hi>Word</hi> of God tells him is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Vanity.</p>
                  <p>And as the Will of the Convert does chuſe God above all, ſo it chuſes <hi>other things</hi> with <hi>reference</hi> unto God: It chuſes the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe it declares the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and what it is that will indeed pleaſe him. It chuſes <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>way to God</hi> as Mediator: It chuſes-<hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>pouring out the Soul before God.</hi> Pſal. 62. 18. It chuſes the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> of God, becauſe God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and is to be <hi>found</hi> in them. The <hi>more</hi> Converts have of God in <hi>any thing,</hi> upon <hi>that</hi> thing is put the <hi>higher eſteem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:106042:95"/>
                  <p>2. The Will of the Converts is <hi>ſubject unto Gods Laws and Commandments.</hi> The <hi>Heart of Fleſh,</hi> why do you think it is ſo called? <hi>I will take away the Heart of Stone, out of their Fleſh, and I will give them a Heart of Fleſh.</hi> Why is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Heart of Fleſh? Partly, becauſe it is <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>troubled at Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and partly becauſe it is <hi>ſoft,</hi> and doth <hi>receive the impreſſion</hi> of the Word, and of the Law of God. It is indeed a fleſhly Table on which the <hi>Law of God is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Finger of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 3. God hath written according to his new Covenant Promiſe, his own <hi>Law in the Hearts of Converts,</hi> and there is a voluntary and delightful Obedience yielded, <hi>Pſal. 40. 8. I delight to do thy Will, O my God, yea thy Law is within my Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God ſaies, <hi>I Command:</hi> The Convert an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>I Conſent;</hi> and <hi>Lord! help me to pleaſe thee ſtill more and more;</hi> for I am never <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed my ſelf,</hi> than when I beſt pleaſe thee? Thus the Wills of Converts yield to the Will of God; and in this <hi>harmony</hi> that is between the Humane and the Divine Will, there is a great deal of Sweetneſs: there is really that <hi>inward Peace,</hi> in compariſon of which all the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106042:95"/> of Sence</hi> are but inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>3. The Converts Will <hi>ſubmits unto Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the Croſs:</hi> Where is there a School without a Rod? The Saints do ſtand in need of Diſcipline, and it is well they have it: Afflictions <hi>wean</hi> us from this <hi>VVorld,</hi> they help forward the work of <hi>Mortification,</hi> they <hi>quicken</hi> us in our ſeeking after God, and the more we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> Divinity:</hi> To improve <hi>Chriſts Croſs</hi> and <hi>our own,</hi> is the way to be truly wiſe. The Convert ſees reaſon for ſubmiſſion, for Gods <hi>Corrections</hi> are all <hi>ſtreams</hi> that iſſue from the <hi>Fountain of Love</hi> that is in him, and they do end in the Souls greater Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is its greateſt Profit; and they cauſe the <hi>peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs</hi> to be brought forth in greater plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                  <p>I grant indeed, That Converts may have <hi>Temptations</hi> to, and not only Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to, but alſo great <hi>fits</hi> of <hi>Impatience;</hi> but they do ſtrive, and they are helped in ſtriving, to allay the Storm, and to be calmed into a ſubmiſſion to the will of God. The Converted Soul may ſometimes be too much blinded by the prevalency of Paſſion, and forgetting it ſelf, may complain after ſuch a manner as this.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:106042:96"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Though my daies are</hi> few <hi>on Earth, yet how are they filled with trouble and ſorrow! No ſooner have I got my head from under one wave, but another Billow is juſt ready to overwhelm me. Affliction ſeems to be my</hi> Lot <hi>and</hi> Portion, <hi>and while the wicked of the VVorld</hi> proſper and increaſe in Wealth, and have more than Heart can wiſh, <hi>all the</hi> day long have I been pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and chaſtened every Morning. <hi>If I ſet my heart upon any temporal injoyment, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it is ſtruck at, and like</hi> the Gourd of <hi>Jonah, withers away. And if I am full of Expectation from the Creature, my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is ever fruſtrated, and that which I expected comfort from, proves</hi> Vanity and Vexation of Spirit. <hi>VVhich way ſoever I</hi> look, I <hi>ſee things viſible enough to caſt me down; nothing viſible to ſupport me. O wretched Life! to be always thus under the Croſs! to be</hi> troubled, and bowed down greatly, and to go mourning all the day.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Converted Soul, in its ſits of impatience, is ready to complain: But unto theſe <hi>ravings,</hi> (I call them no other) the Lord is pleaſed in a <hi>ſtill Voice</hi> thus to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable and ſilly Soul! doſt thou</hi> well to be angry? <hi>and by thy needleſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſorrow to help forward thine own Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? haſt thou been a Learner ſo long in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106042:96"/> my School, and doſt thou not underſtand the Method that I uſe in training up my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? I give thee little in the World, but it is that thou mayeſt not dye of a ſurfeit, as thouſands and millions do; I croſs thee in thy expectation from the Creatures, that from my ſelf thou mayeſt expect and receive the more: Thou talkeſt of trouble, but am not I</hi> thy preſent help? <hi>Thou art in the waves, but theſe waters ſhall not</hi> drown <hi>thee, they ſhall only waſh and</hi> cleanſe <hi>thee, and out of them thou ſhalt come forth much more purified.</hi> Soul, <hi>Ceaſe thy diſcompoſure, I command the</hi> Tempeſt <hi>to be ſtill: Whatever my Wiſdom, and my Love ſees convenient for thee, thou ſhalt not want; and to give thee more than is convenient, would be to injure thee. Thò all viſible ſupports fail, I the inviſible and eternal God am always by thee, and ready to ſhew my ſelf ſtrong on thy behalf: My Care ſhall protect thee and provide for thee, and this may be enough and enough to ſuffice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Converted Soul is <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> it is ſatisfied, and as to its Complaints ſilenced, and it replys in <hi>Job</hi>'s language,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth: Once have I ſpoken, but I won't anſwer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further: Now I ſee more fully who and what thou art, and that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106042:97"/> my impatience and diſtruſt in ſuch a God, was only the effect of my ignorance, unbelief and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

My VVill I renounce, and whatever thy VVill is, I willingly aſſent unto: I am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thy Goodneſs and VViſdom will order all things for me the very beſt and wiſeſt way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Will of the Convert is brought to a ſubmiſſion to the Will of God; and as the Convert does ſpeak thus to <hi>God,</hi> ſo he ſpeaks likewiſe unto his <hi>own Soul,</hi> Pſal. 43. <hi>ult. Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope in God; for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my Countenance, and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much for the fifth particular: When the Soul is Converted, there is a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Will of Man unto the Will of God. The Will <hi>chuſes</hi> what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds as moſt eligible, is <hi>ſubject</hi> unto Gods Commands, <hi>ſubmits</hi> to Correction and the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>6. When the Soul is Converted, <hi>thoſe Affections that have evil for their object, do ſpend themſelves on ſin, which is of all the greateſt evil:</hi> Here I ſhall inſtance in <hi>four Affections</hi> that have evil for their Object,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106042:97"/> and when the Soul is indeed turned, theſe Affections ſpend themſelves on Sin.</p>
                  <p>1. Sin is the Converted Souls <hi>Sorrow;</hi> Tears here are very well beſtowed, God hath a <hi>bottle</hi> to put them in; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Tears that flow from worldly ſorrow, are but as common water. The Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinner is never more merry than when doing evil; <hi>When thou doſt evil, then thou rejoycest:</hi> O how glad is he of an opportunity to commit a pleaſing and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tranſgreſſion? but the Convert hath been made <hi>ſo</hi> ſenſible of the evil that is in Sin, that he can <hi>never make light</hi> of it more; he hath been made ſo ſenſible of the evil that is in Sin, that he is really inwardly afflicted, becauſe ſo guilty and defiled.</p>
                  <p>Sin doth provoke divine Anger, and the Wrath of the Almighty is terrible: Sin breaks the Law of God, and the Curſe hereby deſerved is intolerable: Sin cauſes the only Saviour to be neglected, and the Spirit of God to be reſiſted, who ſtrives to draw the Children of men to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: Sin does weaken and wound the Soul, makes it exceeding vile, doth it an inexpreſſible miſchief, and therefore well may Sin be ſorrowed for: Take notice how <hi>David</hi> doth pour out his ſorrow here, <hi>Pſal. 38. 4, 6. My Iniquities are gone over
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:106042:98"/> my head, as an heavy burthen they are too heavy for me; I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. As Sin is the Converted Souls Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſo it is his <hi>Fear</hi> too; the Convert is afraid of contracting <hi>freſh Guilt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome by new Temptations. The Convert is afraid of the <hi>very firſt riſings</hi> of Sin; for Sin is an Enemy, and if once this Enemy be riſen, really it may much diſturb the Peace, and give many a painful blow before it is quell'd again: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert is afraid of Sins <hi>conceiving,</hi> leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived, it <hi>ſhould be finiſhed,</hi> and at laſt <hi>bring forth Death,</hi> Jam. 1. 15. The Convert flies from great Sins, and won't connive at ſmall ones: The Converted Soul is afraid of known and preſumptuous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and it is jealous leaſt any ſhould paſs unknown, and be harboured unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore the Convert Prayes with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 19. 12. <hi>VVho can underſtand his Errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Convert is ſo afraid of Sin, that he will venture upon other evils rather than upon Sin; he will venture upon Poverty, he will venture upon a Priſon, he will venture upon Flames of Martyrdom, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than venture upon Sin. <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo afraid of Sin, though it was attended
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106042:98"/> with the Pleaſures and Preferments of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he did preferr the enduring of Afflictions with the People of God before it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25.</p>
                  <p>3. The Converted Soul <hi>hates and abhorrs</hi> Sin: I wiſh there was <hi>no other hatred</hi> in the World but the hatred of Sin; here the moſt fixed and ſettled hatred would be very commendable. Hatred is an Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that doth aim at the <hi>deſtruction of the thing hated;</hi> he that hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Scripture is ſaid to be a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer;</hi> and he that hateth Sin, nothing ſhort of the death of Sin will ſatisfie him. It is the Converts buſineſs, from the day of his Converſion unto the hour of his Diſſolution, ſtill to be killing and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Sin, and he doth endeavour to advance in doing of this work daily; he labours and ſtrives to kill Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Concupiſence and Senſuality more dead; and being ſenſible that Sin is much above his Match to deal with, he calls in the help of the Spirit of God, that the more effectually he may mortifie the Works of the Fleſh, <hi>Rom. 8. 13. For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Sin is the Converted Souls <hi>ſhame:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106042:99"/> Iſrael</hi> that refuſed to turn, they are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Impudence</hi> and hardneſs of Heart, <hi>Ezek. 3. 7. They will not hearken unto thee, O ſon of Man,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>for they will not hearken unto me; for all the houſe of Iſrael are impudent and hard-hearted:</hi> So <hi>Jer. 8. 12. VVere they aſhamed when they had committed abomination? No; they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh:</hi> But now Converts are aſhamed of Sin, they are confounded before God, becauſe they have ſo much and ſo inexcuſably offended: Heark to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Converted <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. <hi>Surely after I was turned I repented, after I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my thigh; I was aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Shame</hi> in thoſe that are Converts is of great <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> for it makes them to <hi>lye low</hi> before God; it makes them in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>prefer others</hi> before themſelves: The <hi>chief of Sinners,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, being aſhamed, becauſe he <hi>Perſecuted</hi> the Saints; and <hi>leſs than the leaſt of all Saints.</hi> And it makes Converts to <hi>admire the rich</hi> and the <hi>Free Grace</hi> of God, in advancing them to ſuch a dignity, as to become the Children of God, who did ſo juſtly deſerve everlaſting Contempt and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>7. When the Soul is Converted, thoſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106042:99"/> Affections that <hi>have good for their Object, are placed upon God, who is the higheſt and chiefeſt good of all:</hi> Doers of evil have not ſeen God, 3 <hi>John 11. He that doth good is of God, he that doth evil hath not ſeen God.</hi> The Unconverted Sinner, either ſaith in his Heart there is <hi>no God,</hi> or if there be one, the <hi>Creatures are better</hi> and more deſirable than he: This is the Language of every Unconverted Sinners Heart. But the Converted Soul hath ſeen God, and hath ſeen that in God that he loves <hi>God beſt,</hi> and ſtill deſires to love him <hi>better:</hi> How ſtrong are his deſires after God, and when he is pleaſed to manifeſt his Love, to communicate his Grace with a liberal hand, now the Soul hath the greateſt Joy and Delight on Earth. The Converts <hi>Hope</hi> is in God, his expectation of help is from him, and his hope of Happineſs is in him; he is <hi>Zealous</hi> for the Glory of God, and he is Zealous of thoſe Works that are good in his ſight; and whatever a Convert ſees that hath the Image and Stamp of God upon it, that thing is loved for Gods ſake.</p>
                  <p>8. When the Soul is Converted, <hi>the Memory is put to good and holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes;</hi> before it was like a <hi>den of Thieves,</hi> like a <hi>Cage full of unclean and hateful Birds;</hi> but now
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106042:100"/> the Memory is a <hi>Treaſury,</hi> where the <hi>beſt things</hi> are laid up <hi>ſafeſt.</hi> Here I ſhall tell you of four things that the Convert doth remember.</p>
                  <p>1. The Convert remembers <hi>his Creator,</hi> and indeed no <hi>New Creature</hi> doth <hi>forget</hi> him; he remembers his Duty towards him, and the obligations and encouragements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a faithful Performance of it. Wicked Men forget God; trifles they can think of, but God is not in all their thoughts, <hi>Jer: 2. 32. Can a Maid forget her Ornaments, or a Bride her Attire? yet ye have forgot me days without number:</hi> Thoſe that by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are <hi>my People,</hi> and yet really are eſtranged from me, they have forgotten me days without number; but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert remembers God, and deſires to be in his Love and Fear all his days.</p>
                  <p>2. The Convert remembers <hi>the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his death.</hi> The benefits that were purchaſed by ſo great a price, and how the work of Redemption was compleat, when Chriſt roſe from the dead. A ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>memento</hi> is put upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 8. Remember that Jeſus Christ, of the Seed of David, was raiſed from the dead, according to my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The Convert remembers <hi>the VVord,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:106042:100"/> and that effectually and ſeaſonably; he remembers it, ſo as that he is caſt into the <hi>mould of it.</hi> His heart doth ſtand in a we of the Oracles of God, and they are an excellent preſervative againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pſal. 119. 11. Thy VVord have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin against thee. Joſeph</hi> he did ſeaſonably and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually remember that command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> When he had that impure and immodeſt motion made by a Creature that forgot the preſence of God, and her own Duty; and though he was a <hi>ſervant,</hi> and though he was a <hi>young</hi> Man, and an <hi>uamarried</hi> Man; yet he was ſo far from complying with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he reproves the concupiſence and ventures upon the revenge of his impure Miſtriſs.</p>
                  <p>4. Laſtly, The Convert remembers <hi>his latter end, and the judgment that will follow after.</hi> O Brethren, methinks I ſee my ſelf and all you, holding up our hands at the Bar of God. As ſure as you are here, ſo certainly you ſhall ſtand there. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thinks of this at preſent, and he lives and acts as one that is under continual obſervation, <hi>Prov. 5. 21. The wayes of Man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth all his goings.</hi> He lives and acts
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106042:101"/> as one that is perſwaded he muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf to God, and is <hi>exceeding diligent that he may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blameleſs.</hi> That's the Eighth particular. When the Soul is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the Memory is imployed to good and holy uſes.</p>
                  <p>9. When the Soul is Converted, <hi>there is a deſire to be turned to God, still more and more.</hi> That Converſion is not right where there is not a deſire of <hi>progreſſion.</hi> As there is an <hi>inſatiableneſs</hi> in <hi>Sin,</hi> ſo there is an inſatiableneſs in <hi>Grace too,</hi> until there is a compleat Sanctification and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in <hi>Glory.</hi> The Convert in ſome reſpects may be compared unto the <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeches daughter,</hi> ſtill he is crying, <hi>Give, give;</hi> Give more Wiſdom: Give more Grace: Give more ſtrength: Give more of thoſe riches, and treaſures that are durable. It was a ſaying, of one of the Ancient Fathers, who certainly had as great experience of his own Heart, as any of them all, and that was St. <hi>Auſtin, Si dixeris ſufficit, periiſti;</hi> If thou ſayeſt, <hi>I have Grace enough, thou haſt none at all, and art an undone wretch.</hi> He that with <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſays, <hi>I am rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with good things, and have need of nothing;</hi> what a wretched caſe is that Man in? He <hi>knows not that he is poor,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106042:101"/> and miſerable, and blind, and naked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True Converts are ſenſible of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and have recourſe for ſupplies unto the inexhauſtible <hi>fulneſs</hi> that dwells in our Lord Jeſus; and it is their continual work to be cleanſing themſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit, and to perfect holineſs in Gods fear. The true Convert he <hi>is not,</hi> and he is ſenſible that he <hi>ought not</hi> to be content with any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace that he hath already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but he is ſtill longing and crying for more. He wiſhes that the New Creature were better ſhaped in him, and that <hi>Chriſt were more perfectly formed</hi> in him; and being in ſome meaſure <hi>emulous</hi> of Heaven, he doth endeavour to do ſomething for God here, that may reſemble that which is done for him above in Glory.</p>
                  <p>10. Laſtly, When the Soul is Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it <hi>doth act the Body for God,</hi> and cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Members of it to be yielded as Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Convert takes care of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that at thoſe Gates nothing may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er that may betray and inſnare his Soul; and he ſets a watch before the door of his Lips, that out of that door nothing may proceed which may be diſhonouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o God, injurious to himſelf or unto any
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106042:102"/> other. It is but reaſon that care ſhould be taken of the body of a Man that is Converted; And that none of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould be prophaned, ſince the Body is the <hi>member of Chriſt,</hi> ſince it is the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Spirit,</hi> ſince there is ſuch a ſure promiſe made of a <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>Happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I done with the firſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular propounded to be ſpoken to. I have told you <hi>when the Soul may be ſaid to be truly Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, I am to prove, that <hi>till</hi> the <hi>Soul be Converted, Converſion cannot be ſincere.</hi> And there are theſe two or three Arguments that I ſhall produce to make this evident.</p>
                  <p>1. While the Soul is unconverted, <hi>Sin reigns.</hi> The Dominion of Sin lies in the affection that the Soul hath to it: If the Heart regard iniquity, iniquity is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Throne,</hi> and there muſt needs be an abſence of true Grace. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaies, <hi>Pſal. 97. 10. Ye that love the Lord hate evil,</hi> and the Words may be invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ye that love evil,</hi> certainly are <hi>haters of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. While the Soul is unconverted, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſtill keeps Poſſeſſion,</hi> for his ſtrong holds
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106042:102"/> are in the Soul. The unreaſonable Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, the bad Reſolutions, the wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations that are there, theſe, theſe are the ſtrong holds of the <hi>ſtrong man armed;</hi> and therefore, if the Soul be not turned, Sathan hath his Forts ſtanding unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed; and as Sathan hath Poſſeſſion, ſo Mammon is <hi>chief,</hi> if the Soul be not turned; and where Mammon is chief, Mammon is an <hi>Idol.</hi> And to be <hi>turned to God,</hi> and to have Mammon the <hi>great Idol;</hi> theſe two things cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat. 6. 24. No man can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will hate the One and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other; ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. While the Soul is unconverted, all <hi>external Righteouſneſs is but a meer ſhew:</hi> If the Soul be not Religious, the Soul of Religion is wanting. All the works of the hands though never ſo ſpecious, though never ſo good as to the matter of them, are but <hi>dead works,</hi> if the Heart and the Soul of the doer is not in them: Thus it is plain that Converſion cannot be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere unleſs the Soul be Converted.</p>
                  <p>3. I am to demonſtrate the <hi>Neceſſity of the Souls Converſion</hi> unto God. In the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106042:103"/> former Doctrine by many Arguments, I demonſtrated the Neceſſity of Converſion; now I am to demonſtrate the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of turning to God with the <hi>very Soul,</hi> and there are theſe three or four things that I ſhall produce to make this evident.</p>
                  <p>1. The Soul muſt turn, becauſe <hi>God is Allſeeing.</hi> He doth not judge of things according to the outward appearance, but the inward man is open and naked to his view: The Heart may deceive the <hi>by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders;</hi> Ay, and it may deceive <hi>it ſelf;</hi> but all the ſecrets of the Heart are open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that God whoſe Prerogative it is to ſearch the Heart, and try the reins. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Heart be right with God, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all ſeeking of him, is nothing elſe but lies and flatteries, <hi>Pſal. 78. 36, 37. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they did flatter him with their Mouth, and they lyed unto him with their Tongues. For their Heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Soul muſt turn to God, becauſe by <hi>the acts of the Soul God is Principally honoured.</hi> Obſerve it, how is God glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? when the Soul admires his greatneſs and his Majeſty, and is in a manner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with it, <hi>Pſal. 104. 1. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, O Lord my God thou art
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106042:103"/> very great, thou art clothed with Honour and with Majeſty, who covereſt thy ſelf with light as with a Garment.</hi> How is God honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? When the Soul is ſweetly aſtoniſhed and raviſhed with his goodneſs, <hi>Pſal. 31. 19. O how great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee before the Sons of Men.</hi> When the Soul ſees that in God, that is to be found in none elſe; when in its choice it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr God before Pleaſure, God before Wealth; I had rather have God to be mine though alone, than to have all things in the World, and be without him. O now the Soul honours God above all. By theſe and ſuch like acts of the Soul God is chiefly honoured, therefore turning muſt of neceſſity be with the Soul.</p>
                  <p>3. The Soul muſt turn, becauſe it is the <hi>Soul that yields Obedience to the great commands both of the Law and Goſpel.</hi> There is not ſo much as one Precept ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Law or in the Goſpel kept aright, unleſs the Soul keeps it: The ſumm of the Law is <hi>Love,</hi> but Love muſt be with the Heart and Soul; nay it muſt be with <hi>all</hi> the Heart and with <hi>all</hi> the Soul; or elſe it is but a meer ſhadow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106042:104"/> it is but like the Picture of Fire, that hath no more heat in it than the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Snow. Heark what our Lord ſaies to him that asked Him: <hi>Which</hi> is <hi>the great Commandment in the Law?</hi> Jeſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Mat. 22. 37, 38. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind.</hi> And as the Law calls for Love, ſo it requires <hi>Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> God is jealous of his Worſhip, and he will accept of none but that which is worſhip in Truth, <hi>John 4. 24. God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> Now there cannot be worſhip in Truth unleſs it be worſhip in Spirit: All worſhip is but falſe, and if it be falſe it muſt needs be vain, that doth not proceed from the Spirit of the Worſhipper. If you ſhould imploy many hours in a day in pattering over a great many Words that either you don't underſtand, or if you do, you don't mind, all this would be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; nay, it would be abominable. Then for the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The two great commands of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> neither of theſe can be obeyed without the Heart: It is the <hi>Soul and Heart</hi> that believes, <hi>Rom. 10. 10. With the Heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106042:104"/> is made unto Salvation:</hi> And as for Repentance, it is impoſſible that ſhould be true, unleſs the Spirit be contrite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the very Heart be broken: Tears, Complaints, walking ſoftly, rending the Garments, wallowing in Aſhes, this will not prove the truth of Repentance; the Heart muſt be broken, or elſe you have not truly repented, <hi>Pſal. 51. 17. The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of God are a broken Spirit; a broken and a contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe:</hi> And ſo in <hi>Pſal. 34. 18. The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken Heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a conitite Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Laſtly, The Soul muſt turn to God, becauſe Judgment at the great day will be according to Truth: Then the Secrets of all Men will be made manifeſt; when the Lord appears, he will <hi>bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the Counſels of the Heart, and then ſhall every man have Praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. At the great Day, all things, all Perſons will be called by their proper Names; Hypocriſie will be called Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and Saints will be called Saints: No Hypocrite will be owned for a Saint at that day, nothing that is counterfeit will paſs for currant; the Judgment of God will be <hi>according to Truth.</hi> In the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106042:105"/> day of Judgment, only Converſion with the Heart, Converſion with the Soul will paſs for true Converſion: Sincerity will be owned, and it will be Crowned; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie will be unmasked; and, which ſhould exceedingly ſtartle all unſound Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion, Hell is in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner called, The <hi>Portion of the Hypocrite,</hi> as it is ſaid, to be <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſhewed you when the Soul may be ſaid to be converted unto God: I have proved till then Converſion can never be ſincere: I have demonſtrated the Neceſſity of Converſion with the Soul.</p>
                  <p>The Application of this Doctrine remains, I ſhall be but brief upon it. There are two Uſes that I ſhall make.</p>
                  <p>By way of <hi>Information</hi> in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>And by way of <hi>Exhortation</hi> in the ſecond place.</p>
                  <p>From this Doctrine we may be informed concerning ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. If ſincere Converſion be with the Soul, hence we may inferr the <hi>Souls Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi> The Soul is chiefly receptive of the Grace of God. It is the Soul of Man that doth principally partake of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Soul of Man hath a natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106042:105"/> of God, becauſe as God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo, the Soul of Man is a ſpiritual and an immortal Subſtance: And then the Soul doth ſpiritually reſemble God, when it is <hi>renewed in the ſpirit of the Mind,</hi> and when true Holineſs by the Spirit of the Lord is wrought in it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>2. Hence I inferr, the <hi>Souls great worth and value.</hi> Gods Eye is upon your Souls all the while you are in his preſence, and though you do never ſo much, if you deny him your Hearts and Souls, you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he will accept at your hands. <hi>Thouſands of Rams, ten thouſand rivers of Oyl, the firſt-born for the tranſgreſſion, the fruit of the body for the ſin of the Soul,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 7. What doth all this ſignifie? All this is nothing; nay, let me tell you, it is worſe than nothing. Souls are of <hi>great account</hi> with the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. How much was <hi>done,</hi> how much was <hi>paid,</hi> that Souls might be redeemed! And therefore in all your Services, your Souls muſt be ingaged, or elſe the ingaging is to no purpoſe. The Converſion of <hi>one ſingle Soul</hi> to God, is more pleaſing to him, than the <hi>moſt laborious</hi> and heartleſs ſervices of <hi>all the Hypocrites</hi> from the <hi>beginning</hi> of the World to the <hi>very end</hi> of it; theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are ſo far from being pleaſing, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106042:106"/> they are expreſly affirmed to be an <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Hence I inferr <hi>the difficulty of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> If the Soul muſt be converted, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Converſion is a very difficult thing. It is comparatively more eaſie, though hard ſtill, but comparatively it is more eaſie to order the <hi>converſation;</hi> to <hi>bridle</hi> the <hi>tongue:</hi> But to <hi>rule the ſpirit,</hi> to bring the <hi>thoughts into Captivity;</hi> to alter the <hi>bent and natural inclination</hi> of the Will, and to raiſe the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards thoſe things that are above; to make them prized and purſued, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were things utterly ſleighted; this is difficult indeed; and really the difficulty would be <hi>inſup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rable,</hi> were it not for the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the Power of that Reſurrection ſhewed forth by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Chriſt. Before a Soul can turn to God it muſt be new made, it muſt experience the power of Chriſts Spirit, and it muſt <hi>riſe with Chriſt,</hi> or elſe it can never in good earneſt <hi>ſeek thoſe things that are above,</hi> Col. 3. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Hence I inferr, that in Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether we are Converted or no, a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Eye must be upon our Hearts and Souls.</hi> We muſt take our Souls to task and ſtrictly try them, and ſee what is moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> to them, what they <hi>love beſt,</hi> and what it is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106042:106"/> that they <hi>deſire moſt:</hi> And if God in Chriſt be loved, and choſen above all, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Converſion is ſound and ſincere. If the Heart be grieved becauſe it is no more ſuited to God, becauſe it hath no more Faith in him; and though it can't ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 21. 17. <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I</hi> do <hi>love thee,</hi> yet it can ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I</hi> would <hi>love thee! Above all things in the world I deſire to love thee, and to be beloved of thee!</hi> Such a kind of <hi>deſire</hi> as this, doth plainly ſhew that the work of of Converſion is <hi>begun,</hi> notwithſtanding a great many doubts and fears that do remain about it.</p>
                  <p>But if under the higheſt Proſeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if under the moſt conſtant attendance upon all Ordinances, the Heart doth ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go after its Covetouſneſs, the Soul is fond of its Luſts, and of its Vanities, and is reſolved ſtill to be ſo; certainly there is no ſuch thing as a work of Converſion, though there be never ſo <hi>high and mighty a Confidence</hi> that there is. <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. They come unto thee as the People cometh, and they ſit before thee as my People, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; for with their Mouth they ſhew much love, but their Heart goeth after their Covetouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106042:107"/>
                  <p>The Second Uſe is by way of <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> I exhort you all, to <hi>lift up your Souls to God, with a deſire that he would turn them to himſelf.</hi> Naturally your Hearts are in very bad hands, but if you give them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, his hands are powerfull, and good, and ſafe. He can new form your Souls both to and for Himſelf: And therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, give your conſent, and earneſtly deſire that God would take the Work in hand, and Convert every Soul before him to himſelf to day.</p>
                  <p>To prevail with you thus to Conſent and Deſire; I would lay before you theſe following Arguments.</p>
                  <p>1. If your Souls are Converted, they will be <hi>enlivened, though before dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and in Sins;</hi> they will be made alive unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. You will preſently be free from the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> and Condemnation that ye are under; and ye will be made to <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. O what a Life will you lead, when once ye become Converts! your Lives will become Holy, they will be Heavenly, they will be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical: The Spirit of God will be that, and a great deal more unto your Souls, than what your Souls are to your Bodies:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106042:107"/> The Spirit will ſet you at liberty; The Spirit will act and lead you; The Spirit will fill you with his own bleſſed fruits, that are both pure and peaceable.</p>
                  <p>2. If your Souls are Converted, they will be <hi>healed.</hi> Where is the Soul among us that is not ſick of various Maladies? and that Soul is moſt ſick that leaſt feels its ſickneſs. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> and <hi>healing</hi> are joyned together, <hi>Iſa. 6. 10. Leaſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and be Converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> So <hi>Jer. 3. 23. Return ye backſliding Children, ſaith the Lord, and I will heal your backſliding; behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> The Soul is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and the <hi>beſt</hi> part in a Man, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eaſes of the Soul are the <hi>worſt</hi> and moſt dangerous, and conſequently the cure and healing of theſe diſeaſes is moſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable. If thou didſt labour under a death-threatning Malady, how wouldſt thou long to be cured! Poor Man! thy Soul labours under a great many Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and all of them <hi>Hell-threatning</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies; and if thou art not Cured, thou muſt be damned, therefore Cure ſhould be prized, and Converſion and Curing go together.</p>
                  <p>3. If your Souls are Converted, they will
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106042:108"/> be both <hi>beautified and ſtrengthned;</hi> the Image of God, is the Souls Beauty, and Glory, and upon all true Converts this Image of God is Inſtampt. Sin makes men vile, Converſion and Sanctification makes them excellent, ſo excellent that the Scripture plainly affirms that the <hi>World is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of the Saints that are in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. And Strength will follow Converſion as well as Beauty. Who is the ſtrongeſt upon Earth? The anſwer is, the Convert is the ſtrongeſt. All the Unconverted are <hi>without ſtrength.</hi> Alas! they are without Life, and therefore muſt needs be without ſtrength. The Convert is ſtrengthned with might by the Spirit of God, in the inward Man; ſo that he is enabled to do good, he is enabled to bear evils with patience; he is enabled to reſiſt the Enemies of his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is enabled to Fight, and to Conquer; nay, which is more emphatical, he is enabled ſo to conquer, as to be <hi>more than a Conquerer through him that hath loved him,</hi> Rom. 8. 37.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If your Souls are Converted, they will be both <hi>ſatisfied and ſecured,</hi> and what can you deſire more? It would be a <hi>loud lie,</hi> if <hi>Mammon</hi> ſhould ſay that ever he ſatisfied any: All is <hi>Vanity, and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, and there is no profit under the Sun,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 11. But now the Lord
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106042:108"/> with truth doth ſay, <hi>I have ſatiated the weary Soul, and I have repleniſhed every ſorrowful Soul,</hi> Jer. 31. 25. Thoſe Souls that are weary and ſorrowful, ſeem <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off from Satisfaction;</hi> yet theſe weary and ſorrowful Souls, the Lord is able to ſatisfie; Nay in Scripture, we read of <hi>abundant Satisfaction,</hi> Pſal. 35. 8, 9. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy Houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy Pleaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which <hi>increaſeth</hi> the Satisfaction, is, that the Souls of Converts are ſecure; the Hand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Hand of the <hi>Father</hi> which is <hi>greater than all,</hi> is ſufficient to defend theſe Converted Souls from the force of Earth and Hell, and Sin too. If your Souls are lifted up to God; (<hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum Corda:</hi> Up with your hearts unto God;) If your Souls are Converted to Him, they will be ſafe in <hi>Life,</hi> they will be ſafe in <hi>Death,</hi> and immediately after death they will be <hi>paſt</hi> all <hi>danger;</hi> being admitted into <hi>that Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I done with the ſecond Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That Converſion is then ſincere when the very Soul is Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Is this, <hi>That the Word of God is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106042:109"/> the great means of Converſion.</hi> And O that the Word that ſounds in your ears to day, may be found an effectual Means of the Converſion of all the Uncoverted here before the Lord! The Law of the Lord in the Text is ſaid to <hi>Convert</hi> the Soul; becauſe 'tis the Means which the Lord himſelf makes uſe of, and adds an efficacy to, that ſuch an effect may be produced. The Word is ſtyled <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believes,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. And by this Word Faith it ſelf is wrought, whereby the Soul comes to Chriſt, and by him does Convert to God, <hi>Rom. 10. 17. So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God;</hi> and whenſoever the Word is <hi>effectual</hi> to change a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and turn him into a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> 'tis <hi>made</hi> effectual by <hi>no leſs</hi> a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>His</hi> who is <hi>Omnipotent.</hi> Who <hi>hath believed our report?</hi> There's preaching? <hi>And to whom is the arm of the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed?</hi> there's the Power of God graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and gloriouſly manifeſted; that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Preaching to be ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Shew you, <hi>what it is in the Word of God, that is made uſe of as a Means of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Demonſtrate <hi>the aptitude and fitneſs of the Word to be ſuch a Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſhall tell you, <hi>what kind of Means it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:106042:109"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Whence this Means comes to be effectual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Apply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe. <hi>What it is in the Word that is made uſe of as the Means of Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Word <hi>layes before Sinners eyes, the juſt, the ſtrict, the holy Law of God.</hi> It leads them to <hi>Mount Sinai burning with Fire, and to the blackneſs and darkneſs and Tempeſt there:</hi> Where all the Congregation <hi>heard a Voice</hi> that put them into a deadly conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and trembling; <hi>and ſo terrible was the ſight that Moſes ſaid, I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Heb. 12. 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>This Law is the Law of the <hi>onely liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and true God;</hi> the <hi>King eternal, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, the bleſſed and onely Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Who has the higheſt Authority, and full power to impoſe what commands he pleaſes upon the Sons of Men, and they in all duty and reaſon are obliged to yield Obedience to them.</p>
                  <p>This Law of God is ſo <hi>large,</hi> ſo <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and ſo <hi>pure,</hi> that every <hi>evil action,</hi> every <hi>idle word,</hi> nay <hi>every ſinful intent, deſire,</hi> and <hi>thought,</hi> breaks it. Add alſo, that not only the doing, ſpeaking, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106042:110"/> thinking <hi>evil;</hi> but the <hi>not</hi> doing, ſpeaking, and thinking <hi>what is good,</hi> cauſes this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be tranſgreſſed. What fallen Man can reach this Laws exactneſs! Since it <hi>curſes every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them?</hi> Gal. 3. 10. 'Tis a certain, and one of the great Oracles of God, <hi>That by the deeds of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is added, <hi>becauſe by the Law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Sin.</hi> The Laws <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> makes Mans <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>defilement</hi> the more apparent; and the true ſight of theſe goes before Converſion.</p>
                  <p>2. The Word of God ſhews how <hi>all</hi> that have <hi>ſinned,</hi> have <hi>by the Law the Sentence of Condemnation really paſt upon them.</hi> The Sinner that is Unconverted and Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſaid to <hi>be condemn'd already,</hi> Joh. 3. 18. How cold does it ſtrike to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors Heart when the Judge pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Sentence of Death upon him! Bidding him go from the Bar to the Gaol, and from the Gaol to the Gallows, and there ſhamefully end his days! The Law of God Sentences every Tranſgreſſor unto Death, not Temporal only but Eternal: And though the Execution of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is for a while deferr'd, yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:106042:110"/> of being thus ſentenced, ſhould be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affrighting and amazing. The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation paſt by the Law, is very <hi>big</hi> with evils; it <hi>fills Time</hi> with them; nay it comprehends evils enough to <hi>fill Eternity.</hi> The Sinners Life is miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his Death <hi>more</hi> miſerable, and after Death he is <hi>moſt</hi> miſerable, becauſe his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery will never have an end.</p>
                  <p>The caſe of a Man is judged very ill and ſad, who is condemned to be broken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wheel; or to be flead alive; or to be roaſted to death before the Fire: But what's all this, if compared with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentenced to endure the <hi>pains of Hell;</hi> to <hi>dwell with devouring Flames, which the angry breath of the Lord, as a stream of brimstone doth kindle;</hi> to <hi>inhabit everlasting burnings?</hi> The hearing of ſuch a terrible Sentence, has a mighty tendency to ſtartle and make <hi>the ſinners in Sion afraid,</hi> and to cauſe <hi>fearfulneſs to ſurprize the hypocrites,</hi> Iſa. 33. 14. that they may be no longer ſecure while unconverted.</p>
                  <p>3. The Word of God <hi>warns Sinners to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> and the very Warning intimates a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of <hi>eſcaping</hi> it. The Word <hi>from Heaven reveals the wrath of God againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. It tells them,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106042:111"/> that the Lord has an <hi>Armoury,</hi> which he can open at his pleaſure, and <hi>bring forth the weapons of his indignation,</hi> Jer. 50. 15. and there is no Shield for the Obſtinate, no ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before theſe weapons. <hi>Deut. 32. 40, 41. For I lift up my hand to Heaven, and ſay, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering Sword, and my hand take hold on Judgment, I will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</hi> The Lord not only <hi>ſays</hi> but <hi>ſwears,</hi> and that by his <hi>own Life,</hi> which is for ever; that Death and Deſtruction will be the Portion and Reward of them that will not turn, but impenitently perſiſt in their rebellion againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Sinners are in time warned by the Word, of <hi>this Sword</hi> that's <hi>coming.</hi> Ezek. 33. 7. <hi>Son of Man, I have ſet thee a Watchman unto the Houſe of Iſrael; therefore thou ſhalt hear the Word at my Mouth, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n them from me.</hi> They are warned of the <hi>Vials</hi> that are fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>wrath,</hi> as they are filling up the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of their <hi>iniquities:</hi> they are warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the righteous Purpoſe and Decree that is pregnant; before it actually <hi>bring forth</hi> vengeance. <hi>Zeph. 2. 1. 2. Gather your ſelves together; yea, gather together, O Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not deſired, before the Decree bring forth, before the day paſs as the chaffe, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you; before the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106042:111"/> day of the Lords anger come upon you.</hi> And in <hi>thus admoniſhing</hi> them to flee from the wrath that is (without repentance) ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and juſtly coming, there is <hi>much</hi> of <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> ſhew'd them.</p>
                  <p>4. The Word of God <hi>encourages Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by repreſenting him in Chriſt, as ready to be reconciled to, and receive all that turn.</hi> The elect Angels, when they <hi>ſaw God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> admired his <hi>good will</hi> towards <hi>Men,</hi> and proclaimed <hi>Peace on Earth, Luk.</hi> 2. 14. Mercy is not <hi>extorted</hi> from God, for ſinners ſenſible of their ſin and miſery; but he <hi>delights in ſhewing it.</hi> Pardon is <hi>not hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten</hi> at his hand, and againſt his Nature; but he is <hi>ready to forgive.</hi> He is not <hi>almoſt inexorable</hi> when diſtreſſed Souls fear his Power and Wrath, and cry for Peace: but as <hi>they</hi> intreat <hi>Him,</hi> ſo <hi>He</hi> intreats <hi>them</hi> to be reconciled, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. Now then we are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt; as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word ſpeaks of a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> of an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time,</hi> of a <hi>day of Salvation,</hi> in which the Lord ſeriouſly calls Sinners, and the very worſt of them, to turn; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that turns in truth, ſhall graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be received; and his former offences and affronts be they what they will, ſhall

Now the Lord is <hi>neer</hi> to them that <hi>ſeek him,</hi> and ready to be <hi>found;</hi> and if <hi>the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forſake their ways and thoughts,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Him,</hi> he aſſures them he <hi>will have mercy, and pardon</hi> ſo <hi>abundantly,</hi> as ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their <hi>conceptions,</hi> and the <hi>manner and wayes</hi> of mens ſhewing Mercy one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as the <hi>Heaven is high above the Earth, Iſa.</hi> 55. 6, 7, 8.</p>

                  <p>5. In the Word of God, there are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Examples of very great Sinners who have been converted and ſaved.</hi> How great are the <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> which have been done by the God of all Grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort! Stand forth, <hi>O David,</hi> guilty of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murther! firſt defiling the Wife, and then killing the Husband afterwards. Stand forth, O thou great Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who waſt ſo confident in thy ſelf, that thou ſhouldeſt abide the ſoreſt Trial; but didſt ſo baſely ſhrink; and once, twice, thrice, and with Curſing and Swearing didſt deny thy Lord! Stand forth ye <hi>Corinthian</hi> Saints, who were <hi>Fornicators, Idolaters, Adulterers, effeminate, abuſers of your ſelves with Mankind, who were thieves, covetous, drunkards, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, extortioners,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. And all of you proclaim, That <hi>the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with Faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, who himſelf had <hi>obtained Mercy;</hi> although he had been a <hi>blaſphemer, a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor and injurious,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Setting aſide the unpardonable Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and final Impenitency and Unbelief; for ought I know, <hi>Heaven</hi> can ſhew as <hi>great Sinners</hi> as <hi>Hell,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their guilt and filthineſs, <hi>were waſhed ſanctified juſtified in the Name of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106042:113"/> Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> and now their Holineſs is perfected in Glory. This is an encouragement to the worſt of men, to hope, if they return to God they ſhall not be rejected. Nay ſuppoſe there ſhould be now a <hi>greater.

                  </p>
                  <p>6. The Word of God <hi>diſcovers Sinners weakneſs, and where that Strength is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which turning to God will never be.</hi> That Grace which brings Man to God; to Heaven, muſt come from the God of Heaven: Can man <hi>ariſe from the Dead,</hi> till the Voice of the Lord which is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſay, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt?</hi> Can any come to God but by his Son Jeſus? can any come to Chriſt but thoſe whom the Father drawes? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. God <hi>Works to Will,</hi> He <hi>Works to do;</hi> and he does the one and the other <hi>freely</hi> of his <hi>own good Pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. Sinners are then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſeek unto God to do both for them. And He can eaſily take away the Heart of Stone, and give a new Heart and a new Spirit; and cauſe thoſe who before neglected, now to turn into the way of Salvation; and to <hi>work out their

                  <p>In the ſecond Place, I am to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <hi>the Aptitude and fitneſs of the Word to be ſuch a means of Converſion.</hi> What has
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106042:114"/> been ſpoken already, is in part a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it; but this fitneſs of the Word may be further made evident.</p>
                  <p>1. The Word is a <hi>Light which ſhines in a dark place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. and therefore 'tis a proper means to <hi>turn men from darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God.</hi> The Word diſcovers, what the Prince of darkneſs ſtudiouſly endeavours to conceal: Ignorance and Infidelity are the Pillars of Satans Kingdom; he takes much pains to <hi>blind the Minds</hi> of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, that the <hi>Light of the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt who is the Image of God, may not ſhine into them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. This light gives a true and faithful repreſentation of <hi>Sin,</hi> as the moſt <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> thing in the whole World; of <hi>Satan</hi> alſo, as the moſt ſubtle, falſe, envious, malicious <hi>Deceiver</hi> and <hi>Murtherer</hi> of the Sons, nay of the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souls</hi> of men. The Word reveals the Devils <hi>grand ſecret,</hi> that the <hi>Broad way</hi> is the <hi>high Road to Ruine,</hi> which has been trod by all the Damned: Hell at the end of this way, becomes <hi>naked</hi> by the Word of God; which the Lying Spirit would not have at all to be credited, or ſo much as thought on; till Sinners find themſelves thrown into it, and there without any hope of Releaſe and Remedy.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:106042:114"/>
                  <p>2. The Word is a <hi>Perſpective glaſs, which brings things afar off near to the eye, that ſo the Heart may be the more affected.</hi> It ſhews that the <hi>whole</hi> of Time from the very firſt to the very laſt, is but <hi>ſhort,</hi> if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Eternity;</hi> and how the <hi>end of all things is at hand,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 7. and the <hi>Oath</hi> will at length be ſworn, That there ſhall be <hi>time no longer:</hi> Scoffers indeed, <hi>who walk after their own luſts,</hi> do ſay, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of our Lords coming?</hi> They mock at that glorious Redemption which Believers at Chriſts ſecond appearing do expect; and they <hi>laugh at,</hi> till they <hi>feel</hi> the Flaming Vengeance that is to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon themſelves. But the Word ſhews the <hi>Worlds end,</hi> and how 'tis <hi>reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto fire againſt the day of Judgment, and Perdition of ungodly men.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 7. The <hi>day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the Night,</hi> ſadly ſurprizing the moſt of men; <hi>in which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, the Elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat; the Earth alſo and the Works therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Oh dreadful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, to behold the whole World in a Flame! the ſerious and believing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this, conduces very much to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Converſion, and amendment of our wayes. 'Tis the Apoſtles own infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106042:115"/> 
                     <hi>Seeing then that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all Holy Converſation and Godlineſs!</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>3. The Word is an <hi>Hammer to break the Heart.</hi> Contrition and brokenneſs of Heart is one conſtant Ingredient in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: No leſs than Salvation is Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the contrite ones, <hi>Pſal. 34. 18. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken Heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite Spirit.</hi> Now the Word is the Hammer which breaks the Stony, the Rocky Heart to pieces. Thoſe Hearers who <hi>derided</hi> the <hi>Miraculous Gift of Tongues,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Peters Sermon</hi> reached, and <hi>pierced</hi> their very Hearts, and made them cry out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall</hi> we do? <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. Now Sin was ſet in order before their eyes, and charged home upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencos, now they tremble, and are afraid of deſerved Wrath: now their ſtubborn ſpirits begin to yield unto God. They deſire to know upon <hi>what terms</hi> they might be <hi>ſaved,</hi> being willing to <hi>conſent</hi> to <hi>any terms,</hi> rather than miſs of Salvation, and periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
                  <p>4. The Word is a <hi>Fire, to melt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie,</hi> and ſo a proper means of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is indeed a turning from <hi>Sin</hi> to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106042:115"/> 
                     <hi>Holineſs:</hi> 'Tis the Nature of Fire to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Mettal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Droſs: Gold and Silver are refined by being put into the Furnace. Thus the Word alſo ſeparates between the Heart and its vicious and evil Habits and Qualities; it ſeparates between the Soul and its fleſhly and worldly Luſts: <hi>Now are ye clean,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you,</hi> Joh. 15. 3. This Word is very Pure in it ſelf, and Pure in its Operation and Effects: It ſeverely forbids <hi>all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit;</hi> and in this Word we find as a <hi>Precept</hi> concerning Holineſs, that 'tis our Duty to <hi>perfect Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> ſo a <hi>Promiſe</hi> wherein God has ſaid <hi>he</hi> will <hi>work</hi> this Holineſs in them that ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and deſire it, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and you ſhall be clean; from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you.</hi> The Word is a Fire to Melt and Purge the Soul, and then 'tis a <hi>Mould</hi> alſo, into which the Soul is as it were <hi>caſt;</hi> ſo that it has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an excellent form, being conformed to the holy Nature and Will of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>5. The Word is as <hi>Seed, of which the New Creature is begotten:</hi> God himſelf is he who does regenerate all that are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106042:116"/> and he does it of his own meer good Will and Pleaſure; but the Word is the Seed by which he does it, <hi>Jam. 1. 18. Of his own VVill beg at he us with the VVord of Truth, that we ſhould be a kind of Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of his Creatures:</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 23. Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the VVord of God, which liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and abideth for ever:</hi> From this Seed comes the <hi>New Man,</hi> which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. This Word is <hi>quick and powerful,</hi> 'tis pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to quicken and enliven; ſo that the Soul has a new Life, and lives to God, which before was dead in treſpaſſes. This Seed is effectual to a new formation of the Souls faculties and powers: New Eyes there are in the Mind, a new Diſpoſition and Inclination in the Will; the Affections alſo are new, and of low and carnal, they become high, and holy, and heavenly. The Preachers of the Goſpel are the ſowers of this Seed of the Word, and how ſhould they be in travel till a New Creature comes on't, till Chriſt be formed in them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it! <hi>Gal. 4. 19. My little Children, of whom I travel in birth again, till Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. The Word is a proper Means of Converſion, for 'tis the <hi>unerring Rule,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106042:116"/> which ſhews both good and evil:</hi> Evil, that there may be an Averſion from it; Good, that there may be a Converſion to it. The Scripture calls things by their deſerved Names, what that pronounces bad, will be found by the moſt Unbelieving to be bad indeed; and what that affirms to be good, is really good at preſent, and proves beſt at laſt: Here are the Commandments, in conformity to which true Goodneſs lies, and Sin is defined <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>ſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> All this is good in its own Nature, pleaſing to God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and pleaſant unto Man: The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this is underſtood, the more likely 'tis that evil and dangerous wayes ſhould be forſaken, and thoſe Paths choſen and turn'd into, that are ſafe and holy. The Word ſhews what God approves, and what he abhorrs: It ſhews Mans Duty, which is his Priviledge, and that Sin is Mans Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Plague: And he is a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar indeed, <hi>who has learnt to do well, and ceaſed to do evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. The Word is a fit means of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe it is <hi>the Miniſtration of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106042:117"/> Spirit;</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 8. <hi>How ſhall not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit be rather glorious?</hi> The Word of God is of the Spirits Inſpiration, and his own Word he is pleaſed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he moves, and breaths, and acts in it, ſo that Miracles of Grace are wrought thereby: He ſays to the <hi>blind</hi> Mind, <hi>Receive thy ſight,</hi> and know the things that concern thy Peace; to the <hi>Deaf</hi> the Spirit ſays, <hi>Hear my Voice,</hi> and yield Obedience; to the <hi>Dead</hi> he ſays, <hi>Ariſe out of thy Sins, and from the Earth,</hi> in which thou haſt layn ſo long <hi>buried,</hi> and live the <hi>Life of God,</hi> from which thou haſt been ſo long alienated. And as the Spirit thus ſpeaks, ſo he ſpeaks with efficacy: He can work ſo that none ſhall hinder. O bleſſed Word! in which we find that exceeding great and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit; 'tis but <hi>asking</hi> him, and <hi>having</hi> him, and <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sinner is freed from the <hi>bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> the <hi>cords of Vanity,</hi> the <hi>ſnare of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and has both a <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> given him to Convert to God, and to continue and abide with him. 'Tis manifeſt upon all theſe accounts, that the Word has a fitneſs to be a means of Converſion.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I am to tell you,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106042:117"/> what <hi>kind of Means the Word is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The Word is a Means of <hi>Gods own appointing:</hi> Divine Inſtitution is a thing of very great ſignificancy: God indeed can work without means, and againſt them; but if he is pleaſed to appoint them, they deſerve to be uſed, and ſhall not be uſed in vain, if they are uſed ſeriouſly. God appointed <hi>ſeven Trumpets of Rams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> horns</hi> to be blown, and at length the blaſt is more powerful than a <hi>battering Ram;</hi> the Walls of <hi>Jericho fall down to the ground,</hi> and the City is delivered into the hand of <hi>Iſrael, Joſh.</hi> 6. 4, 20. God has appointed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel to lift up their Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces like a Trumpet, to ſhew the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours their Iniquities, to cry to them to turn. The Word is with Power; the ſtrongeſt holds of the Prince of Darkneſs fall down before it, he is caſt out, his works deſtroyed where before he had the ſureſt Poſſeſſion. The Word is ordained of God as the Means of Converſion, 'tis dangerous, and a great Contempt of God himſelf to neglect it; and truly, after a careleſs manner to attend upon it, is the way to grow more hard-hearted and dead in Sin under it.</p>
                  <p>2. The Word is uſually <hi>moſt Powerful when Preached.</hi> Reading of the word muſt

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106042:118"/> of the Word of God, has a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Honour put upon it, as to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Converſion and Faith, <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. How then ſhall they call on Him, in whom they have not believed? and how ſhall they believe on Him, of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall they Preach except they be ſent? as it is written, How beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, that bring glad tidings of good things?</hi> They that are ſent of God, ſcripturally qualified, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and ſet apart to the work of the Miniſtry, 'tis their great buſineſs to <hi>Preach the Word, to be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, to reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2. And when in Sincerity, with an earneſt deſire <hi>to win Souls,</hi> they make the <hi>Truth manifeſt,</hi> and endeavour to <hi>commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to every mans Conſcience in the ſight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 2. the Word of God is the more likely to reach the Conſcience, and to touch and turn the Heart to Him. Glorious things have been done by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The twelve Apoſtles, and if you will add a thirteenth, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> how powerful was the Word in their Mouths to the Worlds Converſion! They did not as they were ſlander'd, <hi>turn the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106042:119"/> down,</hi> but were bleſſed Inſtruments to turn it to God, and to deliver it out of that Idolatry, Superſtition, Ignorance and Wickedneſs, in which it had lain buried for many ages.</p>
                  <p>3. The Word of God is the <hi>higheſt means of Converſion,</hi> Pſal. 138. 2. <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy VVord above all thy Name:</hi> Here chiefly thou doeſt make thy ſelf known in the powerful Effects of thy Grace and Spirit, and in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Promiſes which thou haſt made. The deſign of <hi>Mercies</hi> is, that this <hi>VVord</hi> may be more <hi>minded,</hi> Rom. 12. 1, 2. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that ye preſent your Bodies, a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable, which is your reaſonable ſervice: And be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to this VVorld, but be ye trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the renewing of your minds; that ye may prove what is that good, that accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perfect VVill of God.</hi> Mercies are cords of love to draw us to the Lord, and to conſtrain us to keep his Word and Commandments. The <hi>end of Affliction</hi> is to turn our Eyes, and Hearts and Feet, into the way of Gods Teſtimonies: The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Before he was afflicted he went aſtray</hi> but after he <hi>kept the VVord</hi> with greater care, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. and he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106042:119"/> adds, <hi>v. 71. 72. It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes; the Law of thy Mouth is better unto me, than thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> Affliction is ſent to humble for Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to reduce the wandring Soul, and to bring it back to the Word of God; and when this Word is truly heeded, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and highly prized; then the Soul is indeed Converted. The Word declares the <hi>meaning of Mercies,</hi> the Word is the <hi>Tongue</hi> that utters the <hi>voice</hi> and <hi>meſſage</hi> of the <hi>Rod:</hi> The Word directs what to pray for, and how to pray ſo as to ſpeed, and inſtructs about every other Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>4. If the Word be ineffectual to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>alas! what is likely to become effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious?</hi> When <hi>Wiſdom</hi> had <hi>cryed</hi> long and upbraided fooliſh Sinners with their <hi>hating Knowledge;</hi> when they had been called to turn, with a proffer of the <hi>Spirit to be poured out,</hi> but they refuſed ſtill; their caſe is ſet forth as deſperate: becauſe the Word being rejected, hated and caſt behind their back, nothing was likely to do, or to make them good; dreadful and utter Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is threatned; and inſtead of being pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, they are told they ſhall be derided, and <hi>laught at</hi> in their ruine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20,—30.

                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſe, I ſay, a damned Soul ſhould ſpeak ſuch language to a Sinner that has all along been deaf to the call of the Word, and reſiſted the Spirit of the Lord, he might perhaps be exceedingly amazed; and poſſibly be <hi>frighted</hi> out of his <hi>VVits,</hi>

The Word is a Means which <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and Millions in the VVorld never were ſo much Priviledg'd, as to enjoy.</hi> An <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah</hi> is juſtly deſerved and expected from the People of God of old, becauſe <hi>he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and Judgments to the Children of Iſrael; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as He had not dealt ſo with any Nation, and as for his Judgments they had not known them,</hi> Pſal. 147. 19, 20. How great a part of the World is <hi>Satans Common,</hi> how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comparatively, is ſo much as the <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Incloſure</hi> of our Lord Jeſus. It is the obſervation of a Learned man, that if the World were divided into <hi>thirty</hi> parts, <hi>Nineteen</hi> would be found ſtill <hi>Pagan,</hi> ſix <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan,</hi> and but <hi>five Chriſtian,</hi> take in all of all Perſwaſions. But alas, how much darkneſs is there even in Nations that are called Chriſtian! Ignorance is affected, the Word of God and the Knowledg of it is taken away, though the Scripture ſays that for <hi>lack of it people are deſtroyed, Hoſ.</hi> 4. 6. How Happy would <hi>you</hi> be, that in

                     <hi>this City,</hi> enjoy the light of the Word of Truth, if you would but thankfully and fruitfully improve it. It is as it were <hi>Noon day</hi> with you, whereas in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is but a <hi>dark down,</hi> and in moſt parts of the Earth a <hi>black midnight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, I am to tell you, <hi>whence this Means,</hi> the Word of God, <hi>comes to be effectual to Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis made effectual by the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and this Power he exerts by his <hi>own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 5. <hi>Our Goſpel came not unto you in word only, but in Power alſo, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance:</hi> the wonderful effects of Divine Power wrought by the Holy Ghoſt in the Preaching of the Goſpel, was an Evidence and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that this Goſpel is not the Word of Man, but of God Himſelf. Now the manner of the Spirits working, when he makes the Word effectual to Converſion, I ſhall declare in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. The Spirit impreſſes upon the Sinners Heart the Divine <hi>Authority</hi> of this Word. 'Tis indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>given by inſpiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. When the <hi>Lord</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is <hi>eyed</hi> and <hi>own'd</hi> in his Word, then it ſhews it ſelf <hi>mighty.</hi> If the Meſſengers and Publiſhers of the Word only are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and there is not a <hi>looking beyond
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106042:122"/> them,</hi> they being but <hi>earthen veſſels;</hi> the Word though a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> will be trampled under foot. But when Sinners are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the Spirit makes it evident that the Word is really of God. The demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this, is ſtyled the <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit.</hi> He does demonſtrate the Words divine Authority, ſeveral wayes.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>VVonders,</hi> wrought for its Confirmation, <hi>Heb. 2. 4. God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, according to his own will.</hi> That theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles <hi>were done,</hi> 'tis plain; for the Word of God pretending to Miracles done ſo openly, ſo often, by and upon, ſo many perſons, in the midſt of cunning and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Adverſaries, who were watchful enough to have eſpied the deceit, if there had been any: if ſuch Miracles really had never been wrought, this Word, and the Religion it teaches <hi>would never have been received.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus, though the <hi>Son of God,</hi> when upon Earth, was <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the form of a Servant;</hi> yet affirms himſelf to be the <hi>Saviour of the VVorld;</hi> preaches a Doctrine contrary to Fleſh and Blood; tells all that will be his Diſciples, they <hi>muſt deny themſelves,</hi> and forſake all that is dear to them in this World, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106042:122"/> they are called to it, for the ſake of a Treaſure and Kingdom in Heaven. And often he <hi>appeals</hi> to his <hi>working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> as a Confirmation of his Doctrine that it was from Heaven. Now if ſuch Miracles had never been wrought, the Impoſture would have been ſo apparent, that the Chriſtian Faith would never have been embraced by any of common ſenſe and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis evident alſo, that theſe Miracles were done by <hi>the power of God.</hi> Wonders indeed were wrought by the <hi>Egyptian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> but <hi>outvied</hi> by greater Wonders, effected by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Gods Servant. Theſe Miracles were beyond the Power and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſecond Cauſes: Who could make the <hi>blind</hi> to <hi>ſee,</hi> and the <hi>deaf</hi> to <hi>hear,</hi> and the <hi>lame</hi> to <hi>walk,</hi> but that God who <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Eye, planted the Ear,</hi> and curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>faſhioned</hi> the other Members? Who would <hi>raiſe the Dead,</hi> but the Lord of of Life himſelf?</p>
                  <p>The Spirit further alſo demonſtrates the Words Authority from the accompliſhment of Scripture Propheſies; as concerning <hi>Cyrus building of the Temple,</hi> Iſa. 44. 28. The <hi>King of Grecia</hi> his ruining the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Monarchy,</hi> which was verified in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 21. The <hi>calling of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106042:123"/> the Gentiles,</hi> Iſa. 42. 4. Zeph. 2. 11. How many <hi>falſe Gods</hi> do we find <hi>famiſhed,</hi> and the Lord Jehovah <hi>worſhipped in the Iſles of the Heathen.</hi> It was alſo fulfill'd, which our Lord ſpake, concerning his Death; that after his <hi>being lift up from the Earth, he would draw all men to him,</hi> which was rather likely to drive all men from him: He alſo ſaid he would have a Church to <hi>the end of the VVorld,</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>ult.</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that Earth and Hell can do, he has had one to this very day.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit alſo ſhews the <hi>divine Matter of the Word,</hi> the admirable conſent and agreement of all its parts, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the whole, which is to give Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, and to repreſent him as moſt worthy of Admiration, Praiſe, Faith, Fear, and Love, and Service. Its Precepts are ſo excellent and pure; that if the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Religion would but live according to them, the World might quickly be convinced of the unreaſonableneſs of Infidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A thorow perſwaſion of the Words Authority, is from the Spirit, and has a mighty force to ſtartle the Conſcience, and awe the heart of a Sinner: And to make it ſtoop unto God, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rebellious.</p>
                  <p>2. The Spirit cauſes the Word moſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106042:123"/> 
                     <hi>firmly to be believed, as that which is of moſt certain verity and truth,</hi> this follows upon the former: If it be the Word of God, who <hi>cannot lye;</hi> there is nothing falſe or uncertain in it. Ever ſince Man firſt harkned to the Father of lies, he is very prone to embrace falſhood. He is not to be truſted as a Guide, any further than God guides him; becauſe ſo apt himſelf to err and miſtake. But <hi>let God be true,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, though it follows, <hi>and every Man a Lyar,</hi> Rom. 3. 4. <hi>God cannot be deceived, becauſe he is Omniſcient,</hi> and <hi>his underſtanding is Infinite,</hi> Pſal. 147. 5. And he <hi>will not deceive</hi> any, becauſe he is the <hi>God of Truth.</hi> Whatever has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his Mouth, its certainty is not to be doubted of: <hi>Faith</hi> therefore, which believes whatſoever God ſpeaks, and becauſe he ſpeaks, is indeed the <hi>highth</hi> and very <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lower of Reaſon.</hi> We read of a <hi>Door of Faith,</hi> Act. 14. 27. <hi>They rehearſed all things that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> The Word of God has entrance by Faith, as by a Door into the Heart, and Faith as a Door ſhuts it in; <hi>then</hi> how powerful is it in working! The Commands being lookt upon as indeed the Commands of God, will no longer preſumptuouſly be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106042:124"/> broken; the Promiſes being believed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> for ever, will be embraced. A firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Words truth, is at the bottom of all true Converſion to God; and 'tis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity that is the great reaſon of departing from him.</p>
                  <p>3. The Spirit <hi>powerfully convinces the Sinner how evil a thing Sin is, which the Word of God ſo ſeverely and ſtrictly forbids.</hi> Sin is that which of all things in the World is <hi>moſt of all miſtaken.</hi> If it were rightly known by all, not one in the World <hi>could</hi> love or like it. But moſt are ignorant what 'tis, and whither it tends; and ſecurely and unconcernedly remain under its guilt and power. Mens luſts are ſtyled <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>'Tis the work of the Spirit to diſcover what Sin is. He ſhews how <hi>contrary 'tis to God,</hi> how evil and provoking in the eyes of his Holineſs and his Glory; how <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 'tis to the Law of God,</hi> which is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent, all whoſe Precepts are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106042:124"/> and pleaſant to thoſe that love and keep them. He ſhews likewiſe how <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sin is to Man</hi> himſelf. It loads him with Curſes of various ſorts; it makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing he has to be curſed to him: It does defile, debaſe and wound him; and unleſs he turn from it, it will for ever deſtroy and damn him. 'Tis one thing to be told of all this by <hi>Man;</hi> and another, to have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull diſcovery and Conviction of all this by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> He ſhews the Vanity of all ſins excuſes, pretences and promiſes of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, Peace and Safety.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit ſpeaks very home to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and particularly; and cauſes the Sinner to whom he ſpeaks to hear and heed and tremble. <hi>Thou art the Man that haſt offended God! Thou art the Soul that haſt ſinn'd, and doſt deſerve to dye! Thou art the Fool-hardy Wretch that haſt engaged the Almighty to be thine Enemy! Againſt thy ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs in particular, his wrath is certainly revealed from Heaven! And how ſoon, if thou refuſeſt to forſake thy impious and unrighteous ways, may this wrath fall upon thee, and ſink thee into the bottomleſs pit of Wo. If thou reſolveſt ſtill to go on in thy treſpaſſes, thy very next ſtep may take hold of Hell!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Spirit <hi>reveals Chriſt in the Word,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106042:125"/> and draws the Sinner to him.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt does teſtifie concerning the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Joh. 15. 26. The Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi> And what a Glorious Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony does he give him! Chriſt is the ſumme and ſubſtance of all Supernatural Revelation. All the lines both of the Old Teſtament and of the New, do meet in this Center. The deſign of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to <hi>forſhew</hi> him, as the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker between God and Man, who was to be <hi>wounded for tranſgreſſion,</hi> to make <hi>his Soul an offering for Sin,</hi> to <hi>bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs,</hi> and to be the Author of <hi>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nteous and eternal Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> The New Teſtament, which is the accompliſhment of the Old, does more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare Chriſt: Here the Spirit more plainly tells us, of his Godhead, of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of his Manhood, of his Mercifulneſs, what power he has to ſave; what Bowels of. Pity towards them that ſee they are loſt without him. And in <hi>ſhewing all this,</hi> how does the Spirit ſhew himſelf a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Spirit diſcovers Chriſt, ſo he <hi>draws the Sinner</hi> to him; he cauſes the Word to reach the Heart, and to ſubdue it, ſo that the Heart gladly ſurrenders, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:106042:125"/> freely opens to receive Jeſus, which before by ignorance, prejudice and unbelief was very faſt Bolted and Barr'd againſt him. There can be no turning to God, but <hi>as he is in Chriſt:</hi> for how can guilty and defiled Man, draw near to the Holy and Righteous Jehovah, without a Mediator? And if he be conſidered <hi>in this Mediator,</hi> there is <hi>all poſſible Encouragement</hi> to turn to him.</p>
                  <p>5. The Spirit, as by the Word he works Faith in Chriſt, ſo by the ſame Word, he <hi>cauſes the Sinner to yield himſelf to God:</hi> He that was before <hi>ſtout-hearted and far from Righteouſneſs,</hi> now throws down his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Rebellion, and ſubmitting, cries for Mercy; he dares not ſtill ruſh on in Sin, as <hi>the Horſe into the Battel;</hi> he is made ſenſible that there is no contending with the Almighty, that <hi>none ever hardned themſelves againſt him and proſper'd,</hi> Job 9. 4. Therefore he bows and yields, leaſt he be broke and ruin'd. And as the <hi>Power of Gods anger</hi> makes the Sinner <hi>afraid</hi> of remaining Unconverted, ſo he is <hi>moſt ſtrongly induced</hi> to turn, by the Spirits effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual diſcovery of Gods <hi>Alſufficiency, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Loving-kindneſs.</hi> He ſees plainly, it can never be <hi>well</hi> with him while at a <hi>diſtance</hi> from God; and that in <hi>Him</hi> and in his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106042:126"/> 
                     <hi>Favour,</hi> is really his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Thus the poor Prodigal was afraid of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the far Country, leaſt he ſhould there <hi>periſh for hunger,</hi> and he came hom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to his Fathers houſe, becauſe there <hi>was bread enough and to ſpare,</hi> Luke 15. 17.</p>
                  <p>I come in the laſt place to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I begin with <hi>ſome Inferences</hi> that may be drawn from this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. If the Word of God be the great means of Converſion, hence I infer, <hi>that this Word is a great Priviledge:</hi> The giving us the Light and Influence of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, is acknowleged to be the needful Bounty of the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but the vouchſafing of the Word ſpeaks a more <hi>peculiar favour,</hi> and is a means to convey a far <hi>greater benefit.</hi> In this Word of God, there is a general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, a Proclamation of a general pardon of all offenders againſt the higheſt Majeſty, and that upon the moſt equal terms; that they prize this favour, make uſe of his Sons mediation to obtain it, and conſent by Sin willingly to wrong their own Souls no more. This Word carries in it a Proclamation to <hi>open</hi> the <hi>priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors;</hi> to unlooſe the bonds and fetters, to grant liberty unto all thoſe that are weary
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106042:126"/> of the bondage of corruption, and that are willing to become the Lords Free men; this Word is an <hi>Invitation</hi> to all ſenſible Souls, that perceive they have ſpent their labour for that which <hi>is not bread,</hi> to come for the bread of <hi>God which comes down from Heaven, and which giveth life unto the World,</hi> Joh. 6. 33. O the tender mercy of God, in vouchſafing his Word to any.</p>
                  <p>When the Light of this Word ſhines, it finds Sinners in Darkneſs, imployed in the works of darkneſs, haſtning towards the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever; and it doth give <hi>them the knowledge of Salvation by the remiſſion of Sin, and guide their feet into the way of peace,</hi> Luke 1. 77, 78, 79. Thoſe are <hi>glorious times</hi> indeed, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>Golden age,</hi> when the Word of God is heard by every ear; when Labourers are many and Faithful, and are hard at work for God, for Chriſt, for Souls; when ſaving Knowledge doth fill all the corners of a Land: Happy, happy is that People that is in ſuch a caſe, if they do but rightly improve their priviledge; for this Word doth direct them <hi>to walk in the Light of Gods Countenance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Hence I inferr, how <hi>inexcuſable they are that remain <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverted ſtill under the Word of God, which is the great Means of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106042:127"/> Converſion.</hi> The Light of Nature leaves thoſe <hi>that gloriſie not God as God, without excuſe,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. But the Light of the Word, doth much more take away all Apology from them that neglect it. They that are not Converted to God, when they hear this Word, neglect to trade with one of <hi>the choiceſt Talents</hi> that any of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men can be entruſted with.</p>
                  <p>To paſs over the whole Volume and <hi>Book of Nature,</hi> to take no notice of God in it, though every Creature be deſigned as a Remembrancer of Him; to paſs by the <hi>works</hi> of Providence, and not hereby to be brought to the Fear of, and Faith in God, who exerciſeth <hi>loving kindneſs and Judgment in the Earth;</hi> Nothing can be ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. But for a <hi>Sinner,</hi> a <hi>loſt Sinner,</hi> a miſerable Sinner, that is ready every Moment to fall into Hell; for <hi>this Man</hi> to hear the Goſpel of Chriſt, to have Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſo fully and freely offered to him, and <hi>yet</hi> to be deaf to the offer, to refuſe to turn to the Lord, though hereby he will live for ever; this doth argue a <hi>far more exceeding and exceſſive</hi> madneſs.</p>
                  <p>What can the Unconverted Sinner plead for himſelf, that he doth not turn? Can he ſay, that he hath not been warned to flee from the wrath to come? Alas, the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106042:127"/> Almightys anger and indignation hath often been <hi>pealed</hi> in his ear. How often hath he heard, <hi>Wo to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given to him,</hi> Iſa. 3 11. Can he ſay that he hath not <hi>been called to turn?</hi> No ſuch matter: Wiſdom hath cried aloud, cryed vehemently, <hi>How long ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge; turn ye at my reproof,</hi> Prov. 1. 22, 23. Again, can the Sinner plead that he hath <hi>not had encouragement</hi> to turn to God? No, no; the God of Heaven, the God of Truth, hath ſolemnly proteſted by <hi>his own Life,</hi> that <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners death,</hi> but had rather that he ſhould turn and live: Hear O <hi>Heaven!</hi> Hearken O <hi>Earth!</hi> and judge, whether the Sinner that is called to turn to God, and <hi>won't,</hi> does not deſerve to dy in his iniquities!</p>
                  <p>3. If the Word of God is the great means of Converſion, hence I inferr, that the <hi>Removal of the VVord is a very ſore Judgment;</hi> How ſore, I wiſh that <hi>England</hi> may never feel by ſad experience! A <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of Bread,</hi> is affirmed to be <hi>worſe</hi> than the <hi>Plague of Peſtilence,</hi> worſe than the <hi>Sword of VVar;</hi> though Plague and Sword are very terrible; but a <hi>Famine of the VVord</hi> of God, is the <hi>worſt ſort</hi> of Famine, and it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106042:128"/> is threatned as a puniſhment, which is an <hi>indication of far greater wrath,</hi> Amos 8. 11. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in thoſe days ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a Famine in the land; not a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of Bread, nor a thirſt for water; but a Famine of hearing the VVord of the Lord.</hi> The Antitheſis here between theſe two Famines doth heighten the ſeverity of the puniſhment. A Famine of the VVord is a puniſhment that is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> ſo much the more hurtful, becauſe it reaches the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Men; ſo much the more hurtful, by how much the Soul is more precious than the Body.</p>
                  <p>Ay, but, may ſome one ſay, what great harm is there if there ſhould come ſuch a Famine? I will tell you. To have the VVord of God removed, it is to have the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs ſet,</hi> and all hopes of Converſion and healing quite gone. To have a Famine of the VVord ſent, it is to have a <hi>Church unchurched,</hi> a Vineyard laid waſt, and not only turned into a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> but into <hi>barren and curſed ground.</hi> To have a Famine of the VVord ſent, it is to have the Lord to ſpue a people out of his mouth, and ſay, <hi>I will never return to this Vomit again.</hi> To have a Famine of the VVord ſent, it is to have the Lord to <hi>give a Bill of Divorce,</hi> and upon this Bill
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106042:128"/> of Divorce writ <hi>Loammi;</hi> you are not my people; <hi>Loruhamah,</hi> I will no more have mercy on you. Tremble, tremble, every one that hears me this day, at the thoughts of ſuch a Judgment as a Famine of the VVord of God! Pray! pray, that this Judgment may never be inflicted upon <hi>England!</hi> I read that there was <hi>ſeven years plenty</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before there was the <hi>greateſt Famine</hi> that ever <hi>Egypt</hi> knew. I heartily wiſh that our preſent Liberty, and plentiful injoyment of the VVord of God, <hi>be not a fore-runner of the moſt dreadful Famine of it that ever</hi> England <hi>knew!</hi> Pray it may not be ſo, pray that God would ſtill give you <hi>Paſtors after his own heart!</hi> Pray that God would <hi>cauſe you to lye down</hi> in <hi>green paſtures,</hi> that <hi>he would load you beſides the ſtill waters, that he would reſtore your Souls, and lead you in the paths of righteouſneſs for his Names ſake,</hi> Pſal. 23. 2, 3. And when you pray for this, fill your mouths with Arguments. Tell the Lord of his <hi>own honour,</hi> which his VVord doth direct the Children of Men to yield to him: Tell the Lord of his <hi>Sons Intereſt;</hi> He will neither be believed in, nor known, unleſs there be the VVord of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him: Mention the promiſe that the Father hath made unto the Son the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,

                     <hi>to give him the Heathen for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the utmoſt parts of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 8. That of the <hi>increaſe of his Kingdom and Government, there ſhall be no end,</hi> Iſa. 9. 7. Urge him with that word that he hath ſaid, <hi>the Earth ſhall be filled with Knowledge as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9. Be importunate in pleading ſuch Promiſes as theſe, and it will manifeſt that you prize the VVord of God, and are afraid of its going. And this importunity will be mighty pleaſing to God, and very prevalent with Him.</p>
                  <p>4. Hence I inferr, That <hi>whenſoever the Word of God is effectual to the Converſion of any, there is juſt cauſe of great thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> When means attain their deſigned end, it is a ſatisfaction unto thoſe that uſe them; and the higher and better the end is, the ſatisfaction is the more: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Sinner to God is one of the <hi>beſt things</hi> that can be done in the World: to feed the hungry, to cloath the naked, to relieve the oppreſſed, to cure the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly diſeaſed, to ſheath the Sword of War, and to eſtabliſh Peace in Kingdoms and Nations, <hi>all</hi> theſe are <hi>works very good;</hi> but let me tell you, that the turning of a Sinner unto God doth imply a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:106042:129"/> benefit, becauſe it doth include Eternal Bleſſedneſs. The <hi>loſt Sheep,</hi> the <hi>loſt Silver,</hi> the <hi>loſt Son,</hi> were all miſſed with <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and were all found with <hi>great Joy.</hi> When the Word is Powerful to Convert a Soul; Oh, what a precious thing is then ſecured! It is ſecured from Eternal Miſery, and there is an everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that it ſhall at laſt be brought ſafe unto, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 18. The Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and he will preſerve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When a Sinner is Converted, how thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould he <hi>himſelf be!</hi> for he is catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a Fire-brand out of the burning; he is delivered from <hi>intolerable Wrath,</hi> and intereſted in <hi>unchangeable Love!</hi> How thankful <hi>ſhould Miniſters be,</hi> when they ſee their ſpiritual Offspring, and Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them!

Chriſt compares the Word of God unto Seed, and <hi>evil Angels unto Fowls,</hi> that endeavour to <hi>catch it away as ſoon as ſown,</hi> Mat. 13. 4. that ſo it may be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fruitleſs, or bring forth no fruit unto Eternal Life. When there are a great many Pick-pockets in a Crowd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice, Perſons are the more careful of their Purſes: O what a company of <hi>evil Angels</hi> are <hi>here,</hi> that are <hi>arrant Thieves!</hi> and they will endeavour to rob you of the Word of God; it concerns you to heed the Word, and to hide it in your Hearts, and then it will be ſafe; a <hi>good and an honeſt Heart</hi> will certainly ſecure this Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>6. Hence I inferr, that the <hi>Diſpenſers and Preachers of the VVord</hi> of God, which is the great means of Converſion, <hi>ought highly to be eſteemed in Love for their works ſake,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 12, 13. <hi>VVe beſeech you Brethren, to know them that labour among you, are over in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake, and be at peace among your ſelves.</hi> When Chriſt aſcended up on high,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106042:131"/> far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things, the Miniſtry of the VVord was <hi>a gift</hi> that he did beſtow upon his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. The Miniſters of the Goſpel as they are inſtrumental to <hi>ſeed</hi> the Flock, ſo they are inſtrumental to <hi>make</hi> the Flock too; for the Spirit of God doth accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Miniſtry, and makes it effectual to alter corrupted Nature, ſo that thoſe that were before like <hi>Dogs,</hi> like <hi>Swine,</hi> like <hi>VVolves,</hi> like <hi>Lyons,</hi> are changed, and they become the <hi>Lambs,</hi> and the <hi>Sheep</hi> of the Lord Jeſus. VVhatever kindneſs is done for the Preachers of the Goſpel, it is not comparable unto the kindneſs they do, when they are made inſtrumental unto the Converſion of any. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that wore an <hi>Imperial Diadem,</hi> was ſenſible of this, when he ſaid, <hi>I thank God more that I have been a member of Chriſt, than that I have been the Emperour of the VVorld.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel is the Gift of Chriſt, and if this Gift be deſpiſed, Chriſt the giver is contemned, and the Father which hath ſent him too, <hi>Luk. 10. 16. He that heareth you, heareth me, he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. How earneſtly <hi>ſhould Preachers pray, that the Word in their Mouths may be effectual
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106042:131"/> to Converſion.</hi> Ay, and they ſhould call in the help of <hi>others Prayers too,</hi> that they may ſucceed in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 1. Finally Brethren pray for us, that the word of the Lord might have free courſe and be glorified, even as it is with you.</hi> Every Sermon that the Preacher makes ſhould be the <hi>Gift of Heaven;</hi> it ſhould be the return of Prayer, and both before and after preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; having Heaven, and Hell, and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, all in his Eyes together; being in a holy agony, he ſhould <hi>pray with all poſſible earneſtneſs</hi> that precious Souls may not be irrecoverably loſt and ruined! Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable is the paſſage of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 6. 4. VVe will give our ſelves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto Prayer and unto the Miniſtry of the word.</hi> Prayer is <hi>firſt</hi> mentioned. If by Prayer the Preachers can <hi>prevail with God,</hi> the VVord of God in their Mouths, is the more likely to be <hi>prevalent with Men.</hi> A Preacher ſhould be a <hi>man of Bowels,</hi> and becauſe his own are Marble, he ſhould long after the Converſion and Salvation of Souls in <hi>the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1. 8. Alas, the Souls that are before him, if they won't <hi>hear,</hi> they can't <hi>live:</hi> if they won't <hi>repent,</hi> Deſtruction is at the <hi>door;</hi> if they won't <hi>believe</hi> they <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>damned;</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:106042:132"/> and there is no remedy. How therefore ſhould we cry to the God whoſe VVord we preach, that he would give Grace to repent, Grace to believe, Grace to turn to him; for though a <hi>Paul</hi> be the <hi>Planter,</hi> though an <hi>Apollo</hi> be the <hi>Waterer,</hi> both are nothing, but <hi>God</hi> that <hi>gives the increaſe</hi> he is <hi>all,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 7.</p>
                  <p>8. If the Word of God be the great means of Converſion, then hence I inferr, that, that <hi>Society and Church is to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that takes away this Word from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People.</hi> The true Church it doth concern you to know, and I will tell you how it may be known; it is <hi>built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone,</hi> Eph. 2. 20. There is an agreement between the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and Prophets: This Doctrine ſets forth Chriſt as the Foundation of a Chriſtians Faith and Hope; ſets forth Chriſt as the <hi>only Saviour,</hi> and as a <hi>Saviour to the utmoſt.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>this Doctrine be decryed</hi> by any, thoſe that do decry it are to be avoided. It is certainly Helliſh cruelty unto Souls, to take away the means of Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from them. <hi>That can't be the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, the props of which, are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Word of God, and an implicite
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:106042:132"/> Faith in men.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks plainly, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3, 4. If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt:</hi> and <hi>v. 6. God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But the Practice of many plainly ſhew, that <hi>they are of another mind,</hi> and their mind is this, that if <hi>the Goſpel be revealed, it is revealed to them that are loſt; and that God, inſtead of commanding the Light to ſhine into the minds of thoſe that are ſaved, doth command darkneſs to abide there ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here is an Objection that muſt be removed out of the way. Say ſome, If the common People are permitted to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Word of God, inſtead of being <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God,</hi> they are but likely to <hi>miſtake his Mind,</hi> and to run into <hi>abundance of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> and ſo to hurt and poyſon themſelves. An ordinary Objection, but it is eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.</p>
                  <p>1. This is plainly to <hi>charge the God of Heaven fooliſhly, and blaſphemouſly, as if he had given ſuch a dangerous VVord to his Church,</hi> as that it is not <hi>fit,</hi> or <hi>ſafe</hi> for them to make <hi>uſe of.</hi> The Objectors don't take notice, that God hath with ſuch Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and care compiled the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106042:133"/> Holy Scripture, that it is a Means to <hi>prevent running into Errour,</hi> and the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Knowledge is derived from hence. Hark to the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 119. 105. Thy VVord it is a Light unto my Feet, and a Lamp unto my Path.</hi> Wo to them that <hi>put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> And before <hi>v.</hi> 104. the Pſalmiſt ſaid, <hi>Through thy Precepts I get underſtanding, therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I anſwer to this Objection, That the <hi>Jewiſh Church, though in a State of Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> had <hi>not the VVord of God withheld from them.</hi> All were to read it, all were to meditate upon it, and yield obedience to it: Nay obſerve, that even the Children were not to be Ignorant of the Scripture, <hi>Deut. 6. 6, 7. Theſe VVords that I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine Heart; and thou ſhalt teach them diligently to thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thou ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> If the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> which was a Church in <hi>Minority,</hi> had the Word of God generally vouchſafed, certainly the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> ought not to be denyed it, which are arrived unto a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>greater Maturity,</hi> as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:106042:133"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whereas it is ſaid, that if the common People read the Scriptures, and ſtudy the Word of God, they will be in danger of running into Errour. I anſwer, <hi>How much Errour,</hi> how much miſtake is there in <hi>groſs Ignorance?</hi> Beſides, thoſe men that have been the great <hi>broachers of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Hereſie</hi> in the Church of Chriſt, have been men of <hi>great parts,</hi> and men of profound Learning, as <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> and the reſt. So that if there was any force in this Objection, the Word of God muſt not be medled with by <hi>any at all.</hi> Bleſſed be God, that the humble have a Promiſe of Guidance and Inſtruction from Heaven, <hi>Pſal. 25. 9. The meek will he guide in Judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.</hi> And while Chriſtians are uſing the Word of God, if they cry to the <hi>Father of Lights, that gives wiſdom liberally, without upbraiding,</hi> they ſhall have a <hi>Heart to know him,</hi> that he is the Lord, <hi>Jer. 24. 7. and they ſhall return to him with the whole Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. Hence I inferr, <hi>That we ſhould be ſuch lovers of Mankind, as to wiſh the whole World did enjoy the Word of God, the great means of Converſion.</hi> It ſhould be a ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thought to our Hearts, that though <hi>all mankind</hi> have ſinned, and are in a <hi>loſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106042:134"/> eſtate,</hi> the Word of God that informs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the only Saviour, is <hi>known to ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few!</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church of old for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years did put up that Prayer, and at length it was anſwered in the Vocation and calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Pſal. 67. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>10. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Hence I inferr, How <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable thoſe are, that turn the VVord of God, the great means of Converſion and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into a deadly ſavour to themſelves.</hi> O the evil Nature of that <hi>Sin of unbelief!</hi> the evil Heart of unbelief doth make the greateſt Bleſſings to become Curſes. To grow more blind under the Light; to grow more deaf and diſobedient, the louder God calls; to grow more barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, notwithſtanding all advantages to make you thrive in Grace and Goodneſs; what excuſe can be brought for this? To receive the <hi>Grace of God in vain,</hi> is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great folly; but to <hi>turn the Grace of God into wantonneſs,</hi> to Sin becauſe Grace doth abound, this is to turn <hi>the very</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy <hi>and Antidote</hi> into <hi>Poyſon,</hi> and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the more <hi>certainly,</hi> the more <hi>fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>

That man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word of God grows worſe and worſe, comes daily to hear, but goes away more vain, more filthy, more wedded to his will, and to his hateful and hurtful luſts, this Man is indeed <hi>deſparately</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this man doth <hi>fix himſelf</hi> under the <hi>Laws Curſe,</hi> he pulls down upon his own Head the <hi>Mediators Vengeance,</hi> and after his <hi>hardneſs and impenitent Heart, treaſures up unto himſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is by way of <hi>Reproof.</hi> If the Word be the great means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſeveral ſorts of Perſons are ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reprehended.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe that <hi>diſlike and hate the VVord of God;</hi> theſe are Fools in the worſt and moſt dangerous ſence, that <hi>hate Inſtruction, and caſt the Laws of God behind their backs,</hi> Pſal. 50. 17.

As Chriſt ſays, For which of <hi>my good works do ye ſtone me?</hi> ſo ſay I, For which of <hi>the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106042:135"/> good Effects of the VVord of God do you hate it?</hi> It is Light in darkneſs, a means of conveying Life to the dead, Food to the hungry, a Cordial to the fainting, a Sword to ſecure you againſt, and to conquer your ſpiritual Enemies. And therefore, if you diſlike this Word of God, you are even unto <hi>ſottiſhneſs,</hi> without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It is a Scripture phraſe, <hi>Jer. 4. 22. My people are fooliſh, they have not known me, they are ſottiſh Children, and without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Thoſe are ſharply to be reproved, who <hi>endeavour to hinder the Efficacy of the VVord of God upon others;</hi> this they do by <hi>ill Counſel,</hi> and by <hi>worſe Example.</hi> This they do by being <hi>Contentious againſt the Truth,</hi> and by <hi>pleading for unrighteouſneſs.</hi> This they do by <hi>promoting prejudices</hi> againſt the Word of God; as if the embracing of it, were the way to Melancholick, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſorrow, and ſcorn, which is indeed the way to the trueſt Gain, and the ſureſt Peace. They that are troubled to ſee others minding Heaven, are <hi>ſtrangely dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,</hi> and are become <hi>Factors for Hell;</hi> and diſcover a moſt <hi>diabolical Diſpoſition.</hi> But whatſoever Perſons ſpeak againſt Grace and Holineſs, whatever they ſay for the

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Looſe <hi>Profeſſours of Religion</hi> are to be reproved, who are indeed a <hi>diſcredit to the Word of God:</hi> they come and hear the Word of God, but what are they in their Families? what are they in their Cloſets? what are they in the whole courſe of their Lives? Filthineſs, greedineſs after Gain, exceſſive Drinking, Impurity, Covetouſneſs, theſe things indeed they can ſhew but too much of: But any thing of true Holineſs of Humility, of Strictneſs, of Contempt of this World, of Delight in minding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, they are utter Strangers to. Will you remember one Truth? <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the prophane is very much hindred, by the licentiouſneſs of the Hypocrites;</hi> the <hi>former</hi> won't be prevailed with to turn into the <hi>way of Truth,</hi> becauſe the <hi>latter</hi> by their evil Courſes do make <hi>this way of Truth to be evil ſpoken of,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 2.</p>

                  <p>Thus have I finiſhed the third Doctrine that I raiſed from the Text, <hi>That the Word of God is the great means of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. I come to the fourth and <hi>last Doctrine,</hi> that I raiſed from the words, and that is this. <hi>That in the VVord of God, which is the means of Converſion, there is a Perfection and Sufficiency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law of the Lord is perfect, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Soul: I wiſh that the Power of this Word upon your Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences this day, may be a <hi>ſenſible Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> of this Words <hi>perfection.</hi> There are ſeveral <hi>properties</hi> of this Word, that do <hi>commend</hi> it, and render it much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable than all the Worldly wealth and greatneſs that the Children of Men do ſo much admire. It is of <hi>Heavenly Original;</hi> it is <hi>true,</hi> it is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it is <hi>pure,</hi> it is <hi>powerful,</hi> it is <hi>perſpicuous and plain;</hi> and among other properties of the Word, this is one, it is <hi>perfect.</hi> The Law <hi>of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul:</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifies <hi>pure,</hi> without <hi>mixture, whole</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> having nothing <hi>wanting.</hi> There is no <hi>defect</hi> in this Word of God of any thing that <hi>ought to be there,</hi> and it cannot

                  <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall proceed in this Method.</p>
                  <p>1. I ſhall ſhew you in <hi>what ſence the Word of God is perfect:</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>2. By Arguments I ſhall <hi>prove the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Sufficiency</hi> of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>3. I ſhall give you the <hi>Reaſons why the Perfection and Sufficiency of the Word of God is mentioned,</hi> when <hi>Converſion is ſpoken of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the laſt place, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the Application.</p>
                  <p>1. I am to <hi>ſtate this Perfection</hi> of the Word of God, and to ſhew you in <hi>what ſence</hi> the Word of God is <hi>perfect.</hi> By his Word you are to underſtand, that which is contained in the <hi>Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament;</hi> the Penmen of theſe Scriptures, were the <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and whatever they wrote, they wrote what was by <hi>him dictated.</hi> Holy <hi>Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> And they have given us a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Will of God upon <hi>record;</hi> a full and compleat Declaration of his Mind.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning this Perfection of the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:106042:139"/> Word of God, I ſhall ſpeak,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Negation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>Poſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I am to ſpeak by way of <hi>Negation,</hi> and that in theſe following particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. You muſt <hi>not</hi> underſtand that <hi>the Word is ſo perfect, as that by it ſelf without the concurrence of the Spirit it can give either Grace or Life to any.</hi> The moſt ſaithful and skilful Preachers of the Word <hi>as to ſucceſs,</hi> have many times <hi>laboured in vain:</hi> That Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who ſpake ſo <hi>much,</hi> and ſo <hi>plainly</hi> concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you have him crying out, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> Iſa. 53. 1. Weeping <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> you may hear him complaining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>Jer. 6. 10. To whom ſhall I ſpeak and give warning that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumciſed, and they can't hearken; the Word of the Lord is a reproach to them, and they have no delight in it.</hi> The Word of God in the mouth of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that great Preacher of the Goſpel, it <hi>found,</hi> ay, and it <hi>left</hi> many a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their <hi>Infidelity:</hi> The hearers of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> it is ſaid that divers of them <hi>believed not, Acts</hi> 28. 24. Nay our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Preachers,</hi> the <hi>greateſt that ever was,</hi> that ever <hi>will be,</hi> he thunders out a Wo againſt <hi>Corazin
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:106042:140"/> and Bethſaida,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum;</hi> becauſe the Word that <hi>ſounded from his lips,</hi> did not perſwade them unto Repentance: So that the Word <hi>alone</hi> is not ſo perfect, as to give Grace, as to give Life to any. There is need, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> ſhould <hi>work along</hi> with it; until <hi>He</hi> doth open the eyes of the underſtanding, the Soul ſtill remains under darkneſs; till he doth renew the Heart, the Will will never yield nor ſubmit to God; till he doth put the Laws of God in the <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>write them in the Heart,</hi> they will never be believed, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be liked nor obeyed.</p>
                  <p>2. You muſt <hi>not</hi> think that the <hi>Word is ſo perfect, as to give a knowledge here on Earth as is equal to the knowledge that is in Heaven:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>we know but in part, and we propheſie in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9. And in 12. <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſame Chapter he ſays, <hi>We ſee through a glaſs darkly.</hi> The Greek word it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, We ſee through a Glaſs in a <hi>Riddle;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Truly Heaven is but a Riddle at preſent unto the <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> here on Earth. They are <hi>no more able</hi> to <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>joys,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> that is <hi>there,</hi> they are no more able to comprehend what it is <hi>to ſee
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106042:140"/> God face to face;</hi> than an Infant in the womb can imagine what Light is, than an Infant in the womb can comprehend what <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is, or the myſteries of <hi>State policy:</hi> here is no <hi>Theologia meridiana viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, perfect day,</hi> here is no <hi>beatifical viſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant indeed the Saints are ſometimes brought into the <hi>Suburbs of Heaven,</hi> and when they are there, Oh! what do they <hi>ſee!</hi> They ſee and taſt that in God, that does make the greateſt ſweetneſs of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments deſpicable; and that doth obſcure all Worldly Glory; but yet the Suburbs are not the Heavenly City, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely below it. Hark to the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John 3. 2. Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Wicked Men think <hi>nothing</hi> of what the Saints <hi>ſhall be:</hi> and truly the <hi>Saints themſelves,</hi> when their minds are moſt <hi>elevated,</hi> and <hi>raiſed,</hi> and enabled to to ſee <hi>moſt,</hi> they apprehend but <hi>little</hi> what themſelves ſhall be hereafter. That Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is too <hi>great</hi> a thing for ſuch minds as ours at preſent to <hi>take in: It hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Heart of Man, to conceive what God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:106042:141"/>
                  <p>3. You muſt not think that the VVord is ſo perfect as that the hearing of that is enough, and is to <hi>exclude all other Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Indeed thoſe <hi>Ceremonial Ordinances</hi> that were impoſed only for a <hi>time,</hi> that are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Carnal,</hi> and that were to laſt only till the <hi>evangelical Reformation,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. theſe Ceremonial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are <hi>aboliſhed</hi> under the Goſpel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, <hi>Col. 2. 20, 21. If you be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the World, why as though living in the World, are ye ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Ordinances? touch not, taſt not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not, which all are to periſh with the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the Commandments and doctrines of Men.</hi> But though theſe Ceremonial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are aboliſhed, there are <hi>other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> that God hath Inſtituted, that are <hi>ſtill ſtanding,</hi> and <hi>will remain</hi> and be in <hi>force</hi> till our <hi>Lords ſecond coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Ordinances have a <hi>warrant</hi> from this <hi>perfect Word it ſelf;</hi> and there is a Promiſe made, of a divine, ſpecial, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, gracious preſence with them.</p>
                  <p>As you are to have an <hi>Ear</hi> to hear the VVord, ſo you are to have a <hi>Tongue</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to God, and <hi>praiſe</hi> him; and your Hearts and Tongues ſhould joyn together in ſupplications and thankſgivings: Ay, and you are to have an <hi>Eye</hi> to behold the <hi>Seals</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:106042:141"/> of the Covenant, that ſo your Hearts may be more affected, and your Faith by things ſenſible may be ſtrengthned in God, who hath made and confirmed this Covenant, and will keep it everlaſtingly. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were a <hi>noble Pair indeed;</hi> excellent patterns of <hi>uprightneſs before God;</hi> for they walked in <hi>all the Commands, and in all the Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> Luke 1. 6. It is a great Affront unto the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of Chriſt the Law-giver, when we ſhall give our ſelves a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> as to <hi>ſome Ordinances</hi> that he hath appointed. There is no Ordinance of God to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I am ſure, if any of the Ordinances are neglected through the prevalency of Temptation, the <hi>inward Man</hi> by its <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and by its <hi>trouble,</hi> will quickly find the want of theſe Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>O! prize the Ordinances of God, that you may ſtill enjoy them; <hi>theſe</hi> are the <hi>vehicles of Grace:</hi> Spiritual <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and ſpiritual <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> are conveyed in the <hi>uſe</hi> of them: And thoſe that are the moſt <hi>experienced Saints,</hi> do perceive moſt reaſon to eſteem them.</p>
                  <p>4. You muſt <hi>not</hi> think that the <hi>explaining of the Scripture by it ſelf, is excluded by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it; but rather included.</hi> Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture is not an Argument of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures imperfection, for Scripture if rightly
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106042:142"/> expounded, is expounded <hi>by it ſelf.</hi> To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>as Gods</hi> which is none of <hi>his;</hi> to ſay <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>mind</hi> of God, which indeed <hi>is not;</hi> this is a <hi>daring,</hi> this is a <hi>wicked addition</hi> unto the VVord of God; but to expound the Scripture by it ſelf, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the VVord of God with it ſelf, that ſo we may attain to the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; this is very allowable, nay it is a very needful Duty.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth deliver to us an excellent Rule of Propheſie, <hi>Rom. 12. 6. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether propheſie, let us propheſie according to the proportion of Faith,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. In our expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, this <hi>Analogy and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith,</hi> is very much to be obſerved. Now this Analogy, or proportion of Faith, doth imply the <hi>constant mind of God in the more plain parts of the Scripture;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>contrary</hi> unto <hi>this,</hi> a ſence of the <hi>more obſcure parts,</hi> is in no wiſe to be admitted. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 20. That no propheſie of Scripture is</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>of private interpretation,</hi> or of <hi>Mens own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi> which I think it had better have been tranſlated.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>interpretation,</hi> it may have a double reference; either to the <hi>inſpired Pen-men of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106042:142"/> Scripture themſelves,</hi> who were the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Mind of God unto the Church, and unto the World;</hi> and they ſpake nothing that was <hi>private,</hi> they ſpake nothing that was <hi>their own,</hi> but all that VVord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in inſpired Scripture, it was from God.</p>
                  <p>Or Secondly, This Interpretation may have a reference unto the <hi>Expounders of Scripture:</hi> and whoſoever they are at this day, that do expound the Scripture, that Expoſition it muſt <hi>not be their own.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there was never ſo great a Council aſſembled together; ſuppoſe it was a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council;</hi> yet if they deliver any thing that is <hi>their own,</hi> it would be a <hi>private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,</hi> and it is in no wiſe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The VVord of God is a perfect VVord, and by it <hi>ſelf alone</hi> it is to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shall I give you three Rules? I wiſh they were obſerved! The Rules are theſe. In Mans corrupt and <hi>fallen state, Sin is all in all.</hi> In Mans <hi>renewed state, Christ with his Grace and Spirit is all in all.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in <hi>Glory, God will be all in all.</hi> If theſe three Rules were obſerved, it would help you the better to underſtand the whole Word of God. Thus much be ſpoken by way of <hi>Negation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:106042:143"/>
                  <p>2. I am to ſpeak by way of <hi>Poſition,</hi> and in ſeveral Propoſitions I ſhall tell you in what <hi>ſence</hi> the VVotd of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>1. The VVord of God is perfect <hi>as a Moans,</hi> and therefore in the uſing of it, your Eye muſt be unto <hi>him</hi> who is the Fountain and principal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ficient of all that is truely good. Natural means, as Food to ſuſtain Nature, Phyſick to recover it when it is decayed, have their Efficacy from God; therefore you read, <hi>Mat. 4. 4. That man doth not live by Bread alone:</hi> But now the VVord is a <hi>Moral means,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Efficacy of it is not ſo <hi>common and ordinary</hi> as the Efficacy of Natural means. Nature doth like that which is for its own Preſervation, but the Souls of men are ſo corrupted and beſotted by ſin, that they utterly diſlike what is for their own benefit. Therefore God is ſeriouſly to be ſought unto, that he would <hi>bleſs this Means with ſucceſs,</hi> that of his <hi>own will</hi> he would accompany his VVord, and make it effectual to <hi>Regeneration. James 1. 18. Of his own will begat he us by the Word of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren, the Means of Grace are to be uſed <hi>as Means,</hi> and in no wiſe are they to be advanced <hi>higher,</hi> as if their Efficacy was
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106042:143"/> of <hi>themſelves.</hi> Being ſatisfied in the <hi>work done,</hi> O how many thouſands hath it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from <hi>working out their own Salvation!</hi> and they have periſhed for ever, becauſe they have thought that <hi>bare uſing</hi> of the Means of Grace was ſufficient to ſave them. God is very much provoked to <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> when we place <hi>confidence</hi> in our <hi>own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi> or in the <hi>Means of Grace</hi> which he hath inſtituted. You are forward to hear the Word of God, but you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Word of God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be effectual unto your enlivening, unto your eternal Happineſs, unleſs <hi>God work like himſelf,</hi> along with it. You muſt <hi>hear,</hi> but your Hope muſt not be in the Word <hi>it ſelf,</hi> conſider'd alone by it ſelf; but your Hope muſt be in God, whoſe Word it is: For he hath ſaid, <hi>Look unto me and be ſaved, all ye ends of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. When the <hi>firſt Part of this Word</hi> of God was <hi>written,</hi> and <hi>given as a Rule of Faith, and Worſhip, and Life, it was perfect conſidering the Churches preſent State.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no more than <hi>Moſes's</hi> writings, that Revelation was perfect and ſufficient, concerning the <hi>will of the God of Iſrael,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the preſent ſtate of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you read, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 7. That <hi>Moſes was faithful in all the Houſe of God.</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106042:144"/> gives him this Teſtimony: He ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſrael, life and death;</hi> and told them the <hi>way,</hi> how the one might be <hi>eſcaped,</hi> and how the other might be <hi>obtained, Deut. 30. 19. Moſes</hi> did faithfully deliver the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> that was firſt ſpoken by Gods <hi>own Voice,</hi> and afterwards writ with <hi>his own Finger,</hi> and which is indeed of <hi>perpetual Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> He likewiſe did faithfully deliver the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and the Ordinances of it, which was a <hi>Pre-ſignification</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> what he was <hi>to doe,</hi> how he was to <hi>ſuffer</hi> and to <hi>dye,</hi> that he might make an Atonement for Sin, and that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe his Church and People. The Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. ſayes, That the <hi>Law was our School-maſter, to bring us unto Chriſt.</hi> The Moral Law doth <hi>force</hi> ſenſible Sinners unto Chriſt; becauſe from the Curſe of it they can be delivered no other way but by a Mediator: But the Ceremonial Law doth <hi>inſtruct</hi> concerning Chriſt, and doth notably diſplay his Sufferings, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that he made to the Juſtice of God, and the Benefits of his Crucifixion; and ſo it is our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt: And <hi>Moſes</hi> added the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Law, which concerned <hi>Iſrael</hi> as they were a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> as they were a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Gods own Ordination and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106042:144"/> contrivance. Thus the Word as a Rule of Faith and Life was perfect; and by this Word of God the Elect were inſtructed to turn to God, and at laſt brought ſafe to Glory.</p>
                  <p>3. When the <hi>New Teſtament was added to the Old, then the Church had the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the moſt large and compleat Edition of the Word of God.</hi> And this was ſuited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>greater maturity,</hi> Heb. 1. 1. <hi>God who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake aforetime unto our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> And truly the Son, who is in the <hi>boſom of the Father,</hi> hath made the <hi>fulleſt Declaration</hi> of the Father, and of his Will, unto the Children of men. Chriſt telleth his Diſciples how they were Priviledged in ſeeing him the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and in hearing the Goſpel from his Mouth, <hi>Matth. 13. 17. Many Prophets and righteous men of old deſired to ſee the things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</hi> Indeed that Light that did ſhine in the days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a <hi>perfect Light in a ſence;</hi> that is, it was a Light <hi>converting and ſaving</hi> thoſe that did receive it, and that did walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it: but yet you muſt underſtand that ſince the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> is actually
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106042:145"/> 
                     <hi>riſen;</hi> there is <hi>a greater light that ſhines now,</hi> than ever ſhined <hi>before</hi> ſince the Fall of Man. Thoſe things that <hi>were hid from Ages and Generations, are revealed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> That <hi>vail</hi> that was upon the <hi>face of Moſes,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>obſcurity</hi> of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick Diſpenſation, that <hi>vail is done away in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 12, 13. And in this Word, conſiſting of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſet forth before you all, as <hi>full of Grace and Truth,</hi> and as the <hi>only Hope of Glory.</hi> Underſtand your Priviledge; it is <hi>ſuch a Priviledge</hi> that you enjoy <hi>this day,</hi> that was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to the World till it was about <hi>four thouſand years old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Word of God is ſo perfect, <hi>that a further Revelation is needleſs, and not to be expected:</hi> That Faith that was <hi>once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto the Saints,</hi> it is to be <hi>held faſt</hi> by Saints in all ſubſequent Ages. <hi>That you ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contend,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Jude, ver.</hi> 3. of his Epiſtle, <hi>for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> This <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> ought to be held faſt, and it is a compleat Doctrine. Let <hi>this</hi> go, and really you are <hi>without God, without Chriſt,</hi> without well grounded <hi>hopes of Heaven.</hi> Look into the Second Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:106042:145"/> Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God; he that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> This Word that you find in the Bible, containing the Old Teſtament and the New, doth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>all to you</hi> that God requires you to <hi>believe in order to your Salvation;</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be received as an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> but what the written Word of God doth <hi>propound to you.</hi> And as it informs concerning myſteries of Faith, ſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duties that are to be practiſed; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>6.

It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>to hold faſt that which we have that no man take our Crown,</hi> Rev. 3. 11. The Apoſtle propounds himſelf as an example to be followed; and tells us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. 14. This <hi>one thing I do, forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth to thoſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106042:147"/> things that are before: I preſs towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God.</hi> Here is an alluſion to them that run in a race, who <hi>do not look back</hi> to ſee how much they have <hi>already</hi> run, but ſtill look and run forward, that they may not miſs the prize: <hi>Things behind</hi> may take in <hi>earthly</hi> things; which the Apoſtle had totally <hi>caſt behind</hi> his back, ſo as never <hi>principally</hi> to regard them any more.

                  <p>And as the Word requires us to abide and walk with God, ſo it informs us how we may be ſure to do it. It tells us of his <hi>own right hand which</hi> is ready to <hi>uphold us,</hi> that we may <hi>follow hard after God,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8. It tells us, that the Lord is of <hi>Power to eſtabliſh</hi> us, and to <hi>keep us from falling;</hi> and that if He does <hi>hold us up, we ſhall be ſafe,</hi> and ſhall have <hi>reſpect unto his precepts continually,</hi> Pſal. 119. 117. The Word directs us to be <hi>ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 1. who is the <hi>Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> the <hi>ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> The Word of God ſhews a greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than <hi>Adam</hi> found in <hi>Paradice,</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  <p>7. The Word of God is ſo perfect, <hi>as to guide and bring us ſafe to Glory.</hi> Pſal. 73. 23, 24. <hi>Nevertheleſs I am continually with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand; thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſel, and afterwards receive to Glory.</hi> This Word ſhews the <hi>path of Life,</hi> the <hi>way Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that leads unto the Lords <hi>glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> where there is <hi>fulneſs of Joy, and Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> None ever miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, that follow'd this Words conduct.

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:106042:148"/> the Word of God is <hi>incorruptible,</hi> and <hi>abides for ever;</hi> 'tis by <hi>this</hi> that Believers are wrought upon and raiſed, and fitted for a bleſſed Immortality. Their <hi>Treaſure, Hearts, and Converſations</hi> are in <hi>Heaven now,</hi> while <hi>themſelves</hi> are here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and they are growing <hi>more meet</hi> to be <hi>partakers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> Admirable is the Perfection of the Word, that will infallibly bring all that Believe, and Love, and walk according to it, unto that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed place and State; where there will be a Perfection of Light and of Delight, a perfection of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, a perfection of Happineſs and Joy; and all this will laſt in the higheſt perfection to Eternity. The Apoſtle commends thoſe of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of whom he takes his laſt leave, unto the <hi>Grace</hi> and to the <hi>Word of God:</hi> he knew very well that this was the way to be <hi>built up to Glory.</hi> Act. 20. 32. <hi>And now Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</hi> You ſee in what ſenſe the Word of God is perfect.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, I am to <hi>prove</hi> by Arguments, the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of this Word of God.</p>
                  <p>1. The Perfection of the Word is <hi>very
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:106042:149"/> plainly aſſerted in Scripture:</hi> and if God himſelf affirms his Word to be perfect, that Man muſt needs be very bold and a great Lyar, who ſhall charge it with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; my Text is an evident Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> it makes the ſimple wiſe; and Converts ſinful Souls to God. The Pſalmiſt tells us, He had <hi>ſeen an end of all Perfection;</hi> and then adds, <hi>but thy Commandment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119. 96. The greatneſs of the Greateſt, the riches of the Richeſt, the wiſdom of the Wiſeſt, he had lookt <hi>through,</hi> and lookt <hi>beyond;</hi> but the perfect Word of God was a <hi>Direction,</hi> a <hi>Support</hi> and a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Him, when every thing elſe failed. In this Word there is Wiſdom, and Mercy, and Grace without bounds or limits. It cleanſes the Hearts and Hands of Sinners; and is uſeful to Saints to the very end of their days, and makes their end Peace. Nay 'tis the Churches He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, which ſhe lives Holily and well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Generations.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle calls the VVord of God, <hi>a perfect Law of Liberty,</hi> Jam. 1. 25. <hi>But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo looketh into this perfect Law of Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and continueth therein, he being not a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearer, but a doer of the Work; this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> 'Tis called a Law of <hi>Liberty,</hi> becauſe the commands of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:106042:149"/> the Word, ſo far as they are obeyed, do make the <hi>Obedient free from ſin;</hi> whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is indeed ſlavery, and being free from ſins <hi>ſervitude,</hi> they are no longer under <hi>guilt,</hi> the <hi>curſe,</hi> or <hi>wrath;</hi> but they have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the Priviledges of the Children of God. 'Tis called a <hi>perfect</hi> Law of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe the Doer of it, that perſeveres in his Obedience, ſhall certainly be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his deed. This Law does not only command, but Grace and Strength from the Spirit goes along with it, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it to be kept; and the fruit being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holineſs, the End will be Life eternal.</p>
                  <p>2. By the <hi>Perfection of the Word in the Scriptures, the end of committing it to writing is obtained.</hi> I grant there was a Church and the Word of God in it, before there was a Scripture; and then the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed his Mind from Father to Son by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and this was more eaſie to be done when men were ſo very long lived, as to continue upon Earth very near a thouſand years. <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived in the days of <hi>Adam, Shem</hi> in the days of <hi>Methuſelah;</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> is obſerved to have been born, and grown up to be a man, before <hi>Shem</hi> was taken out of the World. But afterwards it pleaſed the Lord that Tradition ſhould be no longer truſted; but to prevent Corruption in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we have a written Word, which all
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:106042:150"/> are to give diligent heed to. The Word was written that <hi>God might not be forgotten;</hi> the Scripture being conſulted, is the means to keep up the remembrance of him in all ages. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet Pen to Paper, that <hi>after his deceaſe</hi> the things of God might be had <hi>always in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 15. The Word was written, that Men <hi>might not corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Moſes</hi> knew how prone the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to do thus, therefore he <hi>wrote the Words of the Law in a Book,</hi> that they might be a <hi>witneſs againſt them;</hi> and hinder their growing <hi>ſtiff-necked,</hi> and <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious againſt the Lord,</hi> Deut. 31. 24, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the Word was written that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf might not be corrupted,</hi> nor that go under Gods name which is none of his: Were it not for the Holy Scriptures, how eaſily might falſhoods and fables and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions be impoſed upon us, and called the Mind of Chriſt by men of corrupt minds and doſtitute of the Truth! Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the Lord has cauſed <hi>ſo much</hi> to be written that may be <hi>ſufficient to attain his end in writing;</hi> and if ſo, then it follows, that <hi>all Doctrines of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> both for the ordering of our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared in the Scripture. If the Scripture is given to prevent Corruption in Religion, the Scripture is perfect; that,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:106042:150"/> that Corruption may be prevented. If we ſhould ſuppoſe part of the Doctrines and Precepts of the Goſpel never to have been written; why was <hi>leſs care</hi> taken of <hi>theſe</hi> than of the other? How eaſily would <hi>theſe</hi> be forgotten and corrupted? and how could we be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> in their being <hi>truly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed</hi> to us?</p>
                  <p>3. Adding <hi>to the VVord of God is moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereby forbidden;</hi> therefore the VVord is perfect, <hi>Prov. 30. 6. Add thou not unto his VVord, leaſt he reprove thee and thou be found a liar.</hi> Thoſe that are thus preſumptuous to add, are <hi>liars,</hi> and therefore not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by <hi>others;</hi> and they have reaſon to be afraid <hi>themſelves;</hi> for the Reproof and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of the Almighty are terrible. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamp the Kings Head upon counterfeit Coyn, is no leſs than Treaſon. VVhen Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Ceremonies, which make <hi>gain to be godlineſs,</hi> and are inventions of Men, ſhall have Divinity ſtampt upon them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be from Heaven; this is a daring Treaſon againſt the <hi>higheſt Potentate,</hi> the <hi>great Lawgiver, who has Power to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi> In the laſt book of Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, juſt at the cloſe, <hi>plagues are</hi> threatned <hi>to be added</hi> to any man who ſhall <hi>add thereto:</hi> and he that <hi>ſhall take away</hi> from it, God ſays <hi>he will take away his part out of the Book of Life, Rev.</hi> 22. 18, 19.</p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:106042:151"/>
                  <p>4. It is another proof of the VVords per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>that all Spirits are to be tried by it.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan himſelf can <hi>transform himſelf into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of God.</hi> Now 'tis the VVord they are to be tried by. The Spirit of Truth and this VVord always agree; 'tis not a ſubjecting the Holy Ghoſt <hi>to</hi> the Scripture, when we obſerve the agreement between his Inſtructions, his Motions, <hi>and</hi> the Scripture, but we follow his own Direction in the caſe. It would not be a ſubjecting a Prince unto thoſe general Inſtructions which he himſelf has given, whereby his mind might be known: but to examine meſſages even from the Prince, by thoſe Inſtructions, would be VViſdom and Obedience in the Subject: The Spirit of errour and falſhood may ſeem to agree with the VVord, but if the VVord be diligently heeded, the difference will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. If the VVord were not perfect, but much of the Mind of God were really unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the written VVord would be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be a trial and ſtandard of right Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and it would not have been ſaid, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>5. The Word of God is perfect, <hi>for wiſdom to eternal Salvation is derived from it.</hi> Indeed the Wiſdom is from the Father of Lights, but the written Word is the Means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 14, 15. But continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; And that from a child thou haſt known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> What the Apoſtles taught, was committed to writing; the great Doctrine of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, is here mention'd: and this written Word muſt needs be perfect, which was able to make thoſe that received it, wiſe unto Salvation. The Wiſdom in the Goſpel, is <hi>ſo accounted</hi> by them that are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> for this VViſdom excells the <hi>policy</hi> of <hi>Princes, that come to nought;</hi> and is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the <hi>Glory</hi> of Believers, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 6, 7. Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wiſdom of this World, nor of the princes of this World, which come to nought; but we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a mystery; even the hidden wiſdom, which God ordained before the VVorld to our Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>Effect of the VVord of God proves its perfection,</hi> for it <hi>makes us perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works;</hi> here is right <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to inform the Judgment of what
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:106042:152"/> is true; here is <hi>reproof</hi> and conviction of what is errour and falſhood: Here is <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> for miſcarriages in practice; and <hi>instruction</hi> in the way of <hi>righteouſneſs, 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. All Scripture is given by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteouſneſs: That the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> If by the <hi>Man of God,</hi> you mean the <hi>godly Man,</hi> the Scriptures Perfection is evident, in being a Means ſo throughly to furniſh him with Light and Grace, to do all the good works his Lord requires. If by the <hi>Man of God,</hi> you underſtand the <hi>Minister of Christ;</hi> the Perfection of the Scripture is the <hi>more</hi> evident. For thoſe that are called <hi>Stars</hi> in Chriſts hand, <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches, <hi>Labourers</hi> in the Lords Vineyard, may from the <hi>written word</hi> be <hi>throughly furniſhed,</hi> both to teach and to do what is required to <hi>ſave themſelves and thoſe that hear them.</hi>

                  <p>In the third place, I am to give you the Reaſons why the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Word is mentioned, when <hi>Converſion</hi> is ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>1. To intimate the <hi>Imperfection of the Light of Nature.</hi> This Light diſcovers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106042:152"/> things; and to do thoſe things which are contrary to the Light of Nature, is to do very wickedly: but can it be ſaid, that this <hi>Light of Nature is perfect, working Grace, and converting the Soul?</hi> The Heathens that had onely this Light, and were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Supernatural Revelation; did ſpeak ſeveral things excellently concerning God; they had a Notion of another World, of the Souls Immortality, and of Rewards and Puniſhments hereafter; and they give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Counſels as to Wiſdom and Folly, Vice and Vertue. But thoſe of them that had the greateſt Parts and Learning, the ſharpeſt and moſt piercing eyes to ſee moſt, they ſaw nothing of <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh;</hi> they underſtood nothing of <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Price;</hi> of <hi>Gods purchaſing his Church with his own Blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>The Light of Nature is inſufficient to ſhew the way to Heaven. How God will deal with theſe Heathens, 'tis hard to determine. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> indeed aſſerts, That when we come to Heaven, we ſhall ſee <hi>utrumque Adamum, Redemptum &amp; Redempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem;</hi> both the <hi>Adams,</hi> the Redeemer, and him that was redeemed; the Prophets, the Apoſtles: And then he adds, That <hi>Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> the <hi>Cato's,</hi> and the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and ſuch vertuous Men among the Heathen, will be

It is an encouragement in Prayer, that the beſt things may be asked

                  <p>It is <hi>true wiſdom,</hi> a <hi>Spiritual underſtanding</hi> of the Scriptures, that you ſhould cry for. When the Spirit of God diſcovers a <hi>truth</hi> to you, with what Satisfaction will your Mind receive it!

True Knowledge will debaſe the idolized World, and make it <hi>nothing</hi> in your eyes; and it wil humble you, and make you perceive that really you are <hi>worſe than nothing.</hi> How does a clearer Knowledge of God make holy <hi>Job,</hi> much more humble than ever, <hi>Job 42. 5, 6.

That you would be of a <hi>perfect Heart.</hi> That you would <hi>walk in a perfect way.</hi> That you would <hi>ſtand perfect and compleat in all the will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Let your <hi>Hearts be perfect.</hi> The Heart is the very <hi>Seat of Sincerity,</hi> if it be <hi>not here,</hi> 'tis <hi>no where;</hi> 'tis not in the eye, or tongue, or hands, or feet; if the Heart remain as it was by Nature without a change, and is ſtill wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſenſual and earthly; the VVords and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons though never ſo good, ſignifie and avail nothing; nay the better the VVords and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, the greater is the Hypocriſie and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. There are ſeveral <hi>excellent ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> in this Perfection of Heart, which I would preſs upon the Hearts and Conſciences of All.</p>
                  <p>1. Let your Hearts ſhew themſelves perfect <hi>by ſetting God alwaies before them. Walk before me,</hi> ſays God to <hi>Abraham, and be perfect,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. The perfect Heart is ſenſible that Gods eye looks into it, and ſees all that is in it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its eye is alſo upon God, and as there is an <hi>holy awe</hi> of God upon it, ſo 'tis not ſatisfied without his <hi>approbation.</hi> Upright <hi>David</hi> cryes, out, <hi>O Lord; thou haſt ſearched me and known me,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106042:162"/> thou underſtandeſt my thoughts afar off,</hi> Pſal. 139: 1, 2. Thoughts include all the affections, workings and inclinations of the Heart, all theſe were open and naked unto the Eye of Gad. And <hi>David</hi> looks to his Heart accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and he begs that the evil of his Heart might be more plainly diſcover'd to him, that his Heart might be more throughly cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>2. Let your Hearts be perfect, in being <hi>true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing and very ſtudious to pleaſe that God</hi> with whom you have to do. The perfect Heart ſees 'tis highly reaſonable that <hi>Mans Will</hi> in all things ſhould be obedient unto <hi>Gods,</hi> ſince the VVill of God is ſo righteous, good and holy; ſince <hi>He cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You ſhould hate <hi>every abominable thing which he hates,</hi> and what he <hi>delights</hi> in ſhould always be <hi>choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Let your Hearts be perfect, in <hi>refuſing to have a liking, reſpect and regard to any iniquity.

                  <p>1. Wherever <hi>this Church</hi> is, this <hi>perfect Word of God ſhall certainly be.</hi> The Word may ſometimes be Eclipſed in a Church, but never quite extinguiſhed. Indeed when a Church is unchurched, the Word goes. When the Candleſtick is removed, the light in that place is put out. But ſuppoſe a Church to remain, there will be the Word, by which 'twas gather'd, and which is a means alſo to govern and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, in ſpight of all oppoſite Policy and Power. Spiritual hunger is a bleſſed thing, it never ends in <hi>Starving,</hi> but in Satisfaction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. The ſincere Members of the true Church, have this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; therefore they ſhall more or leſs have the food of the Word to ſuſtain and ſtrengthen them. The Great and Good Shepherd will ſome way or other provide for the Sheep of his Paſture.</p>
                  <p>2. This Church ſhall have <hi>the Spirit along with the Word.</hi> We may as well ſuppoſe a living Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Soul, as a true Church of Chriſt without his Spirit: The Spirit is promiſed and given to the Church to abide there for ever, <hi>Joh. 14. 16, 17. I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> Now <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is,</hi> how effectual is the Word! what <hi>Light,</hi> what <hi>Liberty,</hi> what <hi>Power,</hi> what <hi>Peace</hi> is there! The Spirit makes the Means of Grace to attain their end: He fills Ordinances with an Heavenly vertue; he quickens the Dead, enlarges the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:106042:165"/> Heart, cauſes fruit to be brought forth plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; he <hi>comforts</hi> the true Converts, and <hi>ſtabliſhes them in every good word and work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It's matter of Conſolation, that in this perfect Word of God, there is <hi>wiſeſt and ſafeſt counſel given,</hi> Prov. 6. 22. <hi>When thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee, when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall keep thee, when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee.</hi> So Prov. 3. 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt walk in thy way ſafely, and thy foot ſhall not ſtumble.</hi> This Word counſels Converts againſt evil Men, evil Women, evil Angels, an evil World, and againſt every evil work: It never gave bad counſel unto any. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Word are beſt with reference to <hi>Eternity;</hi> and with reference to <hi>Time</hi> alſo: It bids us <hi>paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear;</hi> to live as <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth,</hi> that we may be leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and diſturbed, and keep more <hi>unſpotted from the World.</hi> It bids us <hi>to walk uprightly,</hi> that we <hi>may walk ſurely.</hi> It informs us that all carnal Policy which is joyned with a contempt of God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is onely a cunning contrivance to undo our ſelves; but 'tis <hi>the fear of the Lord</hi> that is the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Wiſdom, and the Knowledge of the Holy is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. In this Perfect Word of God, a <hi>compleat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is found to ſecure Converts againſt the Enemies of their Salvation;</hi> Eph. 6. 13. <hi>Wherefore take unto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all to stand.</hi> This Armour is to be valued indeed, which is <hi>Armour of proof,</hi> which ſecures us againſt the worſt and moſt powerful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; which certainly defends and makes us vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, when ſighting for Eternal life; when thoſe againſt whom theſe Enemies prevail, will ſurely dy the everlaſting Death. The Apoſtle ſpeaks at large
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:106042:165"/> of the pieces of this Armour: We are furniſhed with the <hi>Girdle of Truth;</hi> ſound Doctrine muſt be held faſt, our Judgments well ſettled againſt errour. Here is the <hi>Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs:</hi> Sincere Holineſs muſt be in the Heart; if the Spirit be not right, if the Heart be not clean, there can be no ſafety. Here the <hi>feet are ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace:</hi> The Goſpel, that is the Word of Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God, and that ſpeaks Peace to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, does prepare and fit us to walk in the way of Holineſs; and the difficulties of that way are endured with patience. Here is the <hi>ſhield of Faith:</hi> Believing on Jeſus, reſting on the Promiſes, that in in Him are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> quenches the Fiery Darts of Satan, ſo that true Converts are not ſunk into an Hell of Deſpair by the remembrance of their paſt Sins, which the Blood of Jeſus has made an atonement for; neither are they diſcouraged by fiery Trials, by the ſierceſt Perſecutions. Here is the <hi>Helmet of Salvation;</hi> that is, the <hi>Hope</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Hope is lively, well grounded, will never make aſhamed, and cauſes the Convert to lift up his head with courage, becauſe Redemption and Glory are aproaching. Here is the <hi>Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And unto theſe pieces of Armour, <hi>Preces &amp; Lacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae arma Eccleſiae,</hi> Prayers and Tears which are the Churches Weapons, muſt be added, becauſe we need, not onely Armour but skill and ſtrength to uſe it, from above; then we ſhall prevail indeed, when we are <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> How ſtrong may be the Conſolation, conſidering how compleat and ſtrong the Armour is; how ſtrong the Helper of a Chriſtian! <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10.-18.</p>
                  <p>5. In this Perfect Word of God, the Convert finds

                     <hi>Promiſes that may ſerve to ſupport and encourage him in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Is he afflicted? 'tis in faithfulneſs, and love; not in wrath and hatred, <hi>Prov. 3. 12. Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a Father the Son in whom he delighteth.</hi> And affliction ſhall be profitable, becauſe it ſhall be purifying, <hi>Heb. 12: 10. He,</hi> that is the Father of Spirits, chaſtizeth <hi>for our profit, that we may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his Holineſs.</hi> Is the Convert poor and deſtitute? He may caſt <hi>all his care on God, who cares for him,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. <hi>The young Lions lack and ſuffer hunger; but thoſe that ſeek the Lord, have him to be their Shepheard,</hi> and <hi>ſhall not want any good thing,</hi> Pſal. 34. 10. Is the Convert tempted? His merciful and faithful High-Prieſt was tempted before him; and <hi>knowes how to ſuccour him,</hi> Heb. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> When the Apoſtle was ſorely buffered by Satan, and cries for help; what anſwer has he? See, be encouraged when you ſee 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. And the Lord ſaid unto me, My Grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> Is the Convert deſerted, and troubled, becauſe God hides his face? He has the Name of God, and his everlaſting Covenant to truſt in; and the Face that is now hidden, will be ſhewn again, and dry up the Tears of the deſerted, <hi>Iſa. 54. 7, 8. For a ſmall moment have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee: in a little wrath hid I my Face from thee for a Moment; but with everlaſting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I have mercy upon thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer.</hi>

The Apoſtle, that he might encourage Believers unto diligence, tells them, <hi>Heb. 6. 10.

There is no intrinſick worth in good works to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Heaven; but God has promiſed Heaven and eternal Life, and is Righteous in beſtowing it; but ſtill it muſt be acknowledged his free Gift, and <hi>given through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Mat. 25. 35, 40. mention</hi> is made only of works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Mercy. <hi>I was an Hungred, and ye gave me Meat, Thirſty and ye gave me Drink, I was a Stranger, and ye took me in. I was Naked, and ye cloathed me; Sick, and ye viſited me. I was in Priſon, and ye came to me.</hi> From hence you are to learn how acceptable ſuch works as theſe are; and you ſhould be ſtirr'd up to abound in them; but <hi>other works</hi> are <hi>not excluded;</hi> for afterwards our Lord
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106042:177"/> does <hi>only mention</hi> the <hi>mercileſneſs,</hi> and <hi>uncharitable Omiſſions</hi> of the wicked; and yet 'tis plain from other Scriptures, that their <hi>other Sins</hi> will be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; their not <hi>knowing God,</hi> their <hi>diſobedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>3. The Sentence which will be paſt upon them, will be a <hi>Sentence of Abſolution:</hi> they ſhall be abſolved and acquitted openly before Men and Angels. All their Sins will be forgotten, and buried; there will be an eternal deliverance from the Curſe. With what Admiration, Joy and Triumph will they hear, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World!</hi> Mat. 25. 34. What a Kingdom is that, that never ſhall be moved! What a Crown is that, that is incorruptible! What gladneſs will fill their Hearts, when the Crown of Life is put upon their Heads! The Sentence being pronounced, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently 'twill be done according to this Sentence; poſſeſſion will be taken of the glorious Inheritance, they ſhall <hi>enter into life Eternal,</hi> Mat. 25. 46. Thus of the Righteous.</p>

                  <p>1.

                  <p>2. Not only the <hi>Works</hi> of the Wicked, but their <hi>very Words ſhall all be accounted for.</hi> The Judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks this very plainly, <hi>Mat. 12. 36. But I ſay unto you, that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an account thereof in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> By <hi>idle</hi> words may be meant words uſeleſs and unprofitable to the Speakers and to the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; or <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> according to the Hebrew uſe, may ſignifie, <hi>falſe, deceitful, lying.</hi> God does hear all words at preſent, <hi>Pſal. 139. 4.

And if unprofitable talk will then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, how ſad will be the Caſe of all obſcene and filthy Speakers! of all egregious Lyars! of all injurious Slanderers and Back-biters! of all Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, curſing curſed Swearers! of all whoſe impious Tongues have made bold with the <hi>Blood and Wounds</hi> of God their Judge, and inſtead of ſerious praying, have moſt preſumptuouſly <hi>called upon,</hi> and <hi>dared God</hi> to <hi>Damn them!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. As the works and words, ſo <hi>the Thoughts of wicked men</hi> ſhall be brought into Judgment. Thoughts are Sins, and need forgiveneſs; and ought to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of. Memorable is that which <hi>Simon Peter</hi> ſays to <hi>Simon Magus, Act. 8. 22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thy Heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> If theſe are not repented of and pardon'd, alas, theſe alſo muſt be charged upon Sinners; vaſtly to the increaſing of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106042:178"/> their puniſhment. How innumerable are the Thouſands of thouſands, the Millions of Millions of vain and wicked thoughts, deſires and luſtings that have lodged in the Hearts of the ungodly! The heart ſearcher ſees every one of them; and will make them know at the laſt day, that he remembers all. Proud and Self-conceited Thoughts, and touring imaginations; impure and laſcivious Thoughts, and inward boyling of Concupiſcence; inſatiable Covetouſneſs, and eager projects for <hi>filthy gain;</hi> the ſtirrings of Envy, Malice, Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; the Judge will take notice of all; for <hi>he knows what is in Man,</hi> Joh. 2. 25. It will be a <hi>large Bill of Inditement,</hi> where Deeds, Words and Thoughts are all written down from firſt to laſt, and not ſo much as <hi>

The <hi>Sentence that will be paſt upon the wicked, will be unconceivably full of horrour,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. <hi>Then ſhall he ſay to them on the Left-hand, Depart from me ye Curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this Sentence as ſoon as paſs'd, will be put in Execution. <hi>Now</hi> indeed, ſuch is the patience of God, <hi>Sentence againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily Executed; and therefore ſuch is their Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106042:178"/> and Ingratitude, <hi>the Heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do Evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 11. But at the great day, as ſoon as the wicked are Sentenced, they will be ſent, and forced to go away <hi>into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment,</hi> Mat. 25. <hi>ult.</hi> the words <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>everlaſting Puniſhment</hi> or <hi>Torment,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; for here it is neceſſarily imply'd, that the wicked ſhall certainly <hi>be</hi> to Eternity, that they may be <hi>Puniſhed and Tormented</hi> to Eternity; and they ſhall be ſenſible (elſe it would not be Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) of the Puniſhment they undergo. By eternal Deſtruction, you are not to underſtand eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Annihilation,</hi> or being turned for ever into <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> for if a wicked Man ſhould altogether <hi>ceaſe to be,</hi> he muſt needs alſo <hi>ceaſe to be puniſhed.</hi> For 'tis no more a Puniſhment to be <hi>nothing to Eternity,</hi> than it can be called a Puniſhment to have been nothing from Eternity. Wicked men muſt <hi>be for ever,</hi> and alas they muſt <hi>bear for ever</hi> the Lord's Vengeance and Indignation. I ſpeak thus terribly, not without bowels of Compaſſion towards you. I would fain <hi>fright you</hi> by <hi>telling</hi> you of <hi>Wrath,</hi> and the <hi>Vengeance of eternal Fire,</hi> that you may <hi>never, never feel it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Fourth place, I am to demonſtrate <hi>the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this Judgment.</hi> If Faith concerning it were but more ſtrong; what an Influence would it have upon the Hearts and Lives of them that do believe it! The Arguments to prove a future Judgment are theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. Are there not <hi>fears of this Judgment impreſs't even upon natural Conſcience?</hi> What's the reaſon, that when Men commit the moſt ſecret wickedneſs, that is very unlikely to be known; there is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106042:179"/> a <hi>dread</hi> upon their Spirits? The true reaſon is, Conſcience tells them there is a God, that ſees what Man does not ſee, and that he will judge and puniſh the wickedneſs of which Man takes no notice. This Doctrine of a Judgment to come, of future Rewards and Puniſhments, is written in the Heart of Man by Nature, and he is fain to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer great violence to his own Soul, before he can wear off what is written there; and tho a Sinner become ordinarily very Stupid and Atheiſtical; yet the thoughts and fears of Judgment, will ſometimes, in ſpight of him return upon him. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Conſcience bearing witneſs, and Thoughts accuſing and excuſing;</hi> and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>ſpeaks of the Day when God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 2. 15, 16. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence judges at preſent, and hints a future judgment.</p>
                  <p>2. There is not <hi>ſuch a Diſcrimination made in this World, between the Righteous and the Wicked,</hi> as is ſuitable to the difference that Grace has made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: Therefore there is a Day coming, when there will be ſuch a Diſcrimination. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that in the courſe of Divine Providence at preſent, <hi>no Man can know either Love or Hatred by all that is before him. All things fall alike to all; there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked, to the good, to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth, and him that Sacrificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; and he that Sweareth, as he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Oath,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 1, 2. Nay, often times the worſt of men have in this preſent Life the beſt on 't. We read, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. of a wicked Rich Man <hi>receiving his good things,</hi> cloathed in <hi>Purple and fine Linnen,</hi> and faring <hi>Sumptuouſly every day.</hi> A poor Man ready
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106042:179"/> to ſtarve for Hunger, was laid at this Rich Man's Gate, his <hi>Body was full of ſores,</hi> and yet this Mans <hi>Soul was ſanctified</hi> with Grace; a <hi>good Man</hi> he was, though <hi>here</hi> he <hi>received evil things;</hi> ſince <hi>thus</hi> it is now, there is a day coming when 'twill be <hi>otherwiſe. Job</hi> having ſpoken of the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Wicked in this World, ſtrongly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that in the next World there will be a <hi>dreadful after-reckoning,</hi> Job. 21. 30. <hi>The Wicked is reſerved to the day of Deſtruction, they ſhall be brought forth to the day of Wrath:</hi> This is the day I am ſpeaking of, a day of the <hi>revelation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. <hi>Who then will render to every man according to his works; to them that by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile,</hi> v. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt hath <hi>Promiſed his Church that he will come again to Judgment,</hi> and hath raiſed her hopes and expectations of his coming, <hi>Rev. 3. 11. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come quickly, hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown:</hi> Heb. 10. 36. <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> He thus ſpeaks to his Diſciples, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe alſo in me;</hi> I am indeed about to leave you, but <hi>I go to prepare a place for you;</hi> and aſſure your ſelves, <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo,</hi> Joh. 14. 1,—5. Chriſt is the <hi>Amen, the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs,</hi> he will certainly be the Judge. The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106042:180"/> Church will aſſuredly ſee him at laſt upon the <hi>great White Throne,</hi> and her ſelf ſafe and triumphant at his right hand. When he comes, how will he be <hi>glorified in his Saints,</hi> and how will he be <hi>admired by all Believers in that Day!</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>4. There are <hi>ſeveral things that are haſtening Chriſts coming to Judgment:</hi> The World grows old in Wickedneſs, and all the Sins of the World have <hi>tongues</hi> to cry for the appearing of a <hi>Judge,</hi> to <hi>pay</hi> their <hi>deſerved Wages;</hi> the World grows riper and riper for Vengeance, dryer and dryer for that <hi>Fire</hi> that is to <hi>burn it.</hi> The Church of Chriſt is alſo <hi>haſtning Chriſts Appearing,</hi> with their inceſſant Cryes, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly, Rev. 22. 20. The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come;</hi> not only unto <hi>Sinners</hi> to come to Chriſt, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Christ himſelf</hi> to appear, that he may put an end both to Sin and Suffering: That's the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and language of the Spouſe, <hi>Cant. 8. 14. Make haſte, my Beloved, and be like a Roe, or a young Hart upon the mountains of ſpices:</hi> And this is not the Voice only of the <hi>Church on Earth,</hi> but <hi>they in Heaven</hi> wiſh for, and intreat the ſame thing; <hi>How long, Lord, holy and true!</hi> is heard from the <hi>Souls under the Altar,</hi> Rev. 6. 10.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt Place I come to the <hi>Application:</hi> I begin with <hi>Inferences</hi> from the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. If there will be a Day of Judgment, hence I inferr, that <hi>there is a preſent Providence:</hi> Will the Lord judge all at laſt? ſurely he <hi>obſerves</hi> all now. The Lord Jeſus would have all the Churches, to know as well, that he <hi>ſearches the Reins and Heart,</hi> as that he will <hi>render to every
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106042:180"/> man according to his Works,</hi> Rev. 2. 23. Whether thy Eye be upon God or no, his Eye is never off from thee; 'tis indeed in <hi>every place, beholding the evil and the good:</hi> What a fooliſh Creature haſt thou reaſon to call thy ſelf? who <hi>conſidereſt not in thy heart that God remembers all thy Wickedneſs, Hoſ.</hi> 7. 2. and Gods remembrance at laſt will <hi>rub up thine;</hi> and what thou now forgetteſt, will ſadly be recalled to thy Mind.</p>
                  <p>2. Shall all be Judged? hence I inſerr <hi>the Love of God to the Righteous, and his hatred of Iniquity:</hi> Not one righteous Man, but ſhall be acquitted and received by the Judge; not a righteous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſincere intention, but ſhall be rewarded: It will be found at the laſt day, that a <hi>Widdows Mite</hi> given with a Charitable ſpirit, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ability, was a great deal in <hi>Gods Treaſury;</hi> and that a <hi>Cup of cold Water given to a Diſciple, in the Name of a Diſciple,</hi> was well taken, and ſhall not <hi>go unrewarded,</hi> Mat. 10. 42. And there has not been, there is not a Wicked Man on Earth, but his Sin that has been hunting and purſuing to overthrow him, will <hi>then</hi> find him out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 5, 6. becauſe the Lords <hi>Soul hates</hi> the workers of Iniquity; therefore upon <hi>the wicked he will rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their Cup:</hi> By <hi>fire, and brimſtone, and tempeſt,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a ſuddain, grievous, ſurprizing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Puniſhment; and by <hi>ſnares</hi> underſtand, that they in Hell ſhall never be able to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves out of that Miſery into which their Wickedneſs has brought them.</p>
                  <p>3. If all ſhall be Judged, hence I inſerr <hi>the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106042:181"/> truth of the Doctrine of the Reſurrection:</hi> The <hi>whole Man</hi> has <hi>ſinn'd,</hi> the <hi>whole Man</hi> ſhall <hi>be judg'd</hi> and puniſhed for ſin: Believers are <hi>ſanctified</hi> both in <hi>Soul and Body,</hi> therefore in Body and Soul they ſhall be gloryfied. The Dead ſhall riſe again, all that are <hi>in the Graves ſhall hear the Voice of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and ſhall come forth; they that have done good to the reſurrection of Life, they that have done evil to the reſurrection of Damnation,</hi> Joh. 5. 28, 29. The Grave is only a Priſon for a time, not a Body that is there that ſhall lye there always; the ſame Body that was employed in the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſs, ſhall be raiſed by the Power of the righteous Judge, to ſhare in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited Puniſhment: And the ſame Body of the Saints, the Members of which were uſed as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto Holineſs, by Vertue of its Union with Chriſt, ſhall riſe again, and be <hi>made like unto Chriſts glorious body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3. 21. It is not <hi>another Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> I grant that qualities are alter'd, but the ſubſtance is the ſame, therefore the Apoſtle does not ſtick to ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>4. Will there be a Judgment, 'tis <hi>wonderful there ſhould be ſo much ſecurity in them that hear of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

And take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you unawares; for as a ſnare ſhall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth: Watch ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all thoſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>one</hi> is, more <hi>firmly to believe a Judgment,</hi> and more <hi>frequently to think of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> is, <hi>Be ſure in time to prepare for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. More <hi>firmly believe, more frequently think of Judgment:</hi> You have reaſon to believe it, for the <hi>Judge is ordained,</hi> and though neither Men
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106042:182"/> nor Angels know the day, yet the <hi>day is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Act. 17. 30, 31. <hi>The time of this ignorance God winked at, but now commands all men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World in righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto all, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> The ſtronger your aſſent is unto this, the more ſerious and often will be your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                  <p>To think of Judgment is proper for a <hi>Saint,</hi> that he may be encouraged to fight the good fight of Faith, and perſevere in well doing to the end.</p>
                  <p>To think of Judgment is proper for a <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Man,</hi> to awaken him, and to make him <hi>with fear and trembling to work out his Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's proper for an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> to think of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe then all Masks and Vizours will be pull'd off, all ſhews will be at an end, and <hi>naked Truth</hi> will appear at that day: The Graves will be open'd, and do ye think the <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted painted Sepulchers</hi> will remain ſhut? Oh! then all the concealed Pride, and Filthineſs, and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs, and Senſuality, and Injuſtice, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Profeſſors, will with all their aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be brought to light before Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Oh, how many <hi>demure and ſerious Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> that have been a <hi>covering</hi> to <hi>naughty Hearts,</hi> will then be filled with <hi>Confuſion!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis proper for the <hi>Old</hi> to think of Judgment; they have <hi>one foot</hi> in the Grave already, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>whole body</hi> muſt drop into it, and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt return to God who gave it.</hi> You alſo that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106042:182"/> are <hi>Young</hi> ſhould think of Judgment; have the youngeſt of you any aſſurance of your Lives? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, Children, Youths, do not many of them dye and ſtep into Eternity? and as you ſee them leave the World, ſo certainly they appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and one way or other have their Doom. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you, that Childhood and Youth are Vanity: Would you that are Young be ſerious? the Meditation of Judgment would conduce much to it, <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 9. Rejoyce, O young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy Youth, and walk in the wayes of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes:</hi> He ſays, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> but ſpeaks <hi>Ironically,</hi> and means the <hi>quite contrary;</hi> thou haſt no reaſon at all to rejoyce, whilſt taken with things that are ſeen, and whilſt thou walkeſt in thoſe evil ways which thy Heart naturally does like: Then the Wiſe man ſpeaks ſeriouſly, <hi>But know thou, that for all theſe things God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you ask me, What are the Benefits that will accrue by a firm Belief, and frequent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Judgment? I thus Anſwer to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>1. This will be a <hi>great Preſervative againſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> Look beyond the preſent advantage and delight that Sin boaſts of, and ſee as far as the Judgment-ſeat, this is the way to ſilence the Tempter, and to avoid his ſnare: Would the Lyar dare to ſpeak falſly, if he conſidered, that <hi>all Lyars</hi> ſhall be adjudged to <hi>the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death?</hi> Rev. 21. 8. Would the Unclean Perſon dare to defile himſelf, and run to the Harlots houſe, if he did but believe and conſider that <hi>Whoremongers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106042:183"/> and Adulterers God will judge?</hi> Improve Chriſts Croſs, and think of Chriſts Tribunal, and this will cool and kill Corruptions, and take away the force of your Temptations.</p>
                  <p>2. The Belief and Meditation of Judgment will cauſe you <hi>to uſe this World as not abuſing it,</hi> to make a good improvement of it. You that have this World in great abundance, and have the <hi>cleareſt and largeſt Eſtates;</hi> do you think you are <hi>Proprietors</hi> of what you have? Do you think 'tis <hi>given</hi> or only <hi>lent</hi> you for a time? You are only Stewards intruſted with that which is Gods and not yours, and are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table at the laſt day for all you have received. What <hi>ſad accounts</hi> will moſt give up of <hi>their Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip;</hi> when they muſt be <hi>no longer Stewards! Imprimis,</hi> So much daily for Eating and Drinking to Self, and not to the Glory of God. <hi>Item,</hi> So much for brave Apparel, that Pride might be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and gratified. <hi>Item,</hi> So much for making proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof. <hi>Item,</hi> So much for coſtly and vaſt Paſt-times; a great deal of Wealth, and much more precious Time being waſted together. But unto <hi>good uſes,</hi> to <hi>maintain a Godly and laborious Miniſtry</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to the <hi>poor and needy,</hi> given <hi>very little or nothing.</hi> With <hi>what an Eye</hi> do you think that the <hi>Judge</hi> will look upon <hi>ſuch accounts</hi> as theſe? Think of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that you may holily improve the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mammon, and Chriſt may ſay you have been <hi>Faithful Stewards,</hi> even of <hi>worldly things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The Belief and Meditation of Judgment, will make you <hi>exceeding diligent, that you may be found of your Judge in peace, without ſpot and blameleſs.</hi> With what Seriouſneſs and Fervency will he come to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106042:183"/> Throne of Grace, that has the Judgment-ſeat alſo in his Eye? How will he hear and practiſe, that remembers he muſt be called to an account, how he has done both? He will take care to be ready whenſoever his Lord calls, and that whenſoever his Lord comes, he may find him doing the Work he ſet him about, and <hi>ſo doing it</hi> as He commands.</p>
                  <p>2. The other word of Counſel is this, <hi>Be ſure in time to prepare for Eternal Judgment:</hi> Do this ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, do it preſently, and as your main buſineſs. That you may prepare indeed,</p>
                  <p>1. Be <hi>Accuſers and Judges of your ſelves;</hi> take notice of your Sins, with Grief, with Hatred, and holy Indignation! accuſe your ſelves of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, with ſelf-loathing and ſelf-abhorrency. Look down by Faith into the loweſt Hell, and ſee the terrible but righteous Severity, that is ſhewn there againſt obſtinate workers of Iniquity; then look up to God, and judge your ſelves in his ſight, acknowledging that you have deſerved one of the hotteſt places in that Lake of Fire. Acknowledge he would be <hi>clear in the</hi> foreſt <hi>judgment</hi> he ſhould pronounce upon you, and that He would be <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> tho you ſhould be <hi>damn'd eternally,</hi> Pſal. 51. 4. This <hi>judging of your ſelves,</hi> is the way to prevent <hi>Condemnation with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 31, 32.</p>
                  <p>2. If you would be prepared for Judgment, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus, that you may be juſtified before God at preſent.</hi> Receive Chriſt, who is offer'd in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; rely upon his <hi>Obedience and Sufferings for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt, that's the Bar; you are to place your Confidence in Chriſt Crucified: If juſtified by him now, he will <hi>ratifie the juſtification</hi> at the laſt day, and you ſhall not be condemned then, <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that Condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea, rather that is riſen again; who is at the Right Hand of God, and maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Would you be prepared for Judgment; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted;</hi> let your minds be changed, and turn to God with your whole Heart. This is the way indeed to ſtand before him, <hi>Acts 3. 19. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> The Apoſtle looks as far as the laſt day. <hi>Blotting out of Sins,</hi> is Chriſt's <hi>abſolving and acquitting them</hi> from all Treſpaſſes. The time of refreſhing, is that great day of <hi>compleat and glorious Redemption,</hi> when all that are Chriſts ſhall lift up their Heads with Joy: Repent and be converts in Truth, if you would have that a day of refreſhing, and not of confuſion. Walk after the Fleſh no longer, but after the Spirit; then you need not be afraid of Condemnation, your being guided by his Spirit, will ſhew you are in Chriſt, and ſafe in Him, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; to be carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded, is life and peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>USE III. Of <hi>Terrour</hi> to the <hi>ungodly,</hi> the <hi>Hypocrite
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106042:184"/> and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers;</hi> Chriſt will judge them all, and they may tremble to think what kind of judgment they ſhall have: what ſharp and piercing words are thoſe, which declare before-hand what will be their Doom, <hi>Mat. 23. 33. Ye Serpents, ye Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> That I may, if it be poſſible, awaken ſuch, I would lay before them theſe terrifying conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>1. When they appear at Chriſt's Bar, <hi>all their ſecret wickedneſs will be made known.</hi> How many will then be found what they were not in the leaſt ſuſpected! Thy ſecret wantonneſs, and Self-pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; thy ſecret injuſtice and defrauding; thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret abominations, of all kinds, will then be as <hi>viſible to every Eye,</hi> as if written in <hi>Capital Letters</hi> with the <hi>brighteſt Sun-beam.</hi> And what ſname and confuſion will cover the wicked Mans Face! they that are impudent, and cannot bluſh now; how will they be confounded then! The truth is, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>They will riſe to ſhame and everlaſting contempt,</hi> Dan. 12. 2.</p>
                  <p>2. At the day of Judgment it will be <hi>too late, and in vain for the wicked to pray and cry for Mercy;</hi> they will find the Lord eternally removed from the Throne of Grace, and to their Terrour behold him on the Judgment Seat. If the Ungodly roar out, then, <hi>Lord pity! Lord pardon!</hi> Lord, <hi>ſend us not away into that flaming Furnace that we ſee before us!</hi> it will be altogether in vain: But 'tis not in vain to cry thus now. <hi>Oh, ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call ye upon him whilſt he is near,</hi> Iſa. 55. 6.</p>
                  <p>3. It will add to the Terrour of the Wicked, <hi>That the Sentence of Condemnation is pronounced by the Only Saviour:</hi> The <hi>merciful and faithful High Prieſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106042:185"/> that now is ſo forward to <hi>make Reconciliation for Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> are heavy laden.</hi> The <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus will have no pity at all, no compaſſion towards the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate <hi>Children of Men;</hi> but deal with them as with the Apoſtate Angels, <hi>whoſe Nature he never</hi> took upon him. The only Peace-maker will himſelf be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, and full of Wrath, as not to be intreated not to be appeaſed. The Sentence of Eternal Death, and enduring everlaſting Burnings, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding; but 'twill <hi>add</hi> to the <hi>Confuſion,</hi> that a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> does <hi>pronounce</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>4. After the Judge has paſs'd the Sentence, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will pronounce it over again,</hi> and will be a <hi>Judge</hi> to the Wicked, <hi>always condemning</hi> them. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be filled with unſpeakable remorſe; it will continually be upbraiding them with their madneſs and folly in <hi>keeping</hi> their <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>loſing</hi> their <hi>Souls;</hi> and will ever be telling them, that <hi>the Lords ways towards them are equal, but their own ways according to which they are judged, have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,</hi> and full of Iniquity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 29, 30. The Conſcience of Sinners will <hi>ſide</hi> with their Judge againſt them. It will tell the moſt wretched among the Damned, that they cannot <hi>complain of God,</hi> or of the <hi>leaſt injury</hi> he has done them; all that they ſuffer, they ſuffer <hi>juſtly;</hi> and what they ſuffer, <hi>they</hi> have brought upon <hi>themſelves.</hi> The horrible and perpetual <hi>remorſe</hi> of Conſcience, will prove that the <hi>Worm never dies,</hi> that does torment them.</p>
                  <p>5. When Sinners come to be condemn'd at the laſt day, <hi>how many things will riſe up in judgment againſt them?</hi> (pray mind this, and minding trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106042:185"/> and trembling turn to God this very inſtant.) Thouſands of <hi>Mercies</hi> will come, and as it were plead thus: <hi>Lord! we have been all abuſed, we never met with any thing but abuſes, and never could lead theſe men to Repentance!</hi> The Rods of Affliction will have a <hi>Voice</hi> againſt them too. <hi>Lord! we have ſtricken theſe Sinners often, we have made them Bleed and Groan, and ſmart exceedingly for their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; but could never make them leave off Sinning againſt Thee, and againſt their own Souls!</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons will riſe up in judgment againſt them; becauſe they either <hi>ſlept</hi> them away; or if they were awake, they ſuffer'd them to <hi>ſlip</hi> out of their <hi>Memories,</hi> and never <hi>applyed</hi> them to their <hi>Hearts!</hi> And as for us, the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Goſpel, our <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt them will be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>terrible. Lord! we lifted up our Voices like Trumpets; we gave them the Watchmans Warning, we told them of the Sword that was coming, and that if they turned not from Sin, it would ſurely ſlay them: we wooed them to come to Jeſus, that under his Wing they might be ſecure; but nothing would prevail; their Ears were deaf, their Hearts they hardened, they would not be converted and made clean, they would ruſh on in Sin ſtill, they would needs Dye, and there was no helping it!</hi> The Condemnation muſt needs be dreadful, when ſo many things riſe up againſt them that are condemned!</p>

Lift up your Heads, and let your Hearts be filled with Joy; all ye believing, repenting, humble, holy, heavenly-minded Ones! for the Day of your Redemption draws nigh,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106042:186"/> with an earneſt expectation wait for it, and Triumph at the Thoughts of your great and everlaſting <hi>Jubilee.</hi> You will indeed behold the greateſt part of mankind turned into Hell; but what Joy will it be to find your ſelves for ever ſafe and fully bleſſed! A dark Shadow ſets off a beautiful Picture. The ſight of the Rich man in Hell Flames, muſt needs make <hi>Lazarus</hi> to find a greater ſweetneſs in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome!</p>
                  <p>Two Grounds of Conſolation I ſhall propound to you, and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p>1. He is to be <hi>your Judge,</hi> that is <hi>your Husband</hi> and <hi>your Head.</hi> The very ſame whom you now find interceding for you in Prayer; whom you ſee walking in the midſt of the Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and bleſſing his Ordinances to you. The very ſame whom you have found pitying, and healing your Wounds with his own Blood; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring you in your Temptations, and telling you that you are the Beloved of his Soul! And ſince <hi>he</hi> is to Judge you, be comforted. He will behold you with an aſpect, that is highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable! His <hi>own Spouſe,</hi> whom he has ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his <hi>own Life,</hi> Chriſt will not turn into devouring Fire! He will not take the Members of his own Body, and throw them into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Burnings! Having <hi>Redeemed</hi> them by his <hi>Blood,</hi> having <hi>renewed and Sanctified</hi> them by his <hi>Spirit;</hi> having <hi>raiſed</hi> them up at the great day; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he will receive them to himſelf, and they ſhall be <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17, 18. <hi>wherefore be comforted with theſe words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. You that are true Believers, whoſe Faith purifies your Hearts and works by Love; know
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106042:186" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>that there is a Crown deſigned for you.</hi> The <hi>Diadems</hi> that Monarchs have upon their Heads; the <hi>Triple Crown</hi> of Him at <hi>Rome,</hi> is but a <hi>Trifle</hi> to the <hi>Crown of life.</hi> This Crown is purchaſed, 'tis promiſed, 'tis prepared; and ſhortly you ſhall put it on, and never put it off more. How Splendid, how Bright, how Sparkling, will that Crown be! 'Tis called a Crown of Life, for Death ſhall be no more. A Crown of Glory, for the Saints ſhall be more than Conquerours, and Triumphant over all Enemies, and be advanced to the higheſt Honour and State, whereof they are capable. Finally, 'tis called a Crown of <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> 'tis a <hi>Righteous thing with God,</hi> to beſtow it through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and perfect Righteouſneſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will be a great part of the happineſs of Saints in Glory. This Crown the Apoſtle ſaw to his great encouragement, and he would have all other Believers comforted with the ſame ſight, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8. I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day, and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi>

                  <p>OUR Lord Jeſus is called the <hi>Lamb of God who takes away the Sins of the World:</hi> But in this Lamb there is <hi>Wrath,</hi> and that Wrath is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible. Oh the weight of the Mediatours Vengeance! This Wrath is threatned againſt the impenitent and unbelievers, who refuſe to be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their Sins, reſolving to live,</hi> tho they <hi>Dye</hi> in them. The <hi>Light</hi> of the Goſpel being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, highly aggravates the <hi>Works of Darkneſs;</hi> makes them more inexcuſable, and a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words which I have read, do ſpeak Chriſt's ſorrow and his diſpleaſure, wherein you may take notice,</p>
                  <p>1. Of the <hi>Perſons</hi> with whom he is diſpleaſed, <hi>Thou Capernaum;</hi> the City is put for the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Here is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Chriſts diſpleaſure; they did not underſtand the great priviledge of <hi>being Exalted unto Heaven;</hi> they did not improve the advantage they had of getting thither.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106042:187"/>
                  <p>3. Here is a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> threatned, a ſore evil; and that is no leſs than Hell it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>4. Here is the <hi>manner</hi> ſpeciſied of their <hi>going to Hell;</hi> thou ſhalt be <hi>brought down to Hell,</hi> with a ſtrong Hand, with great Wrath, and in one of the hotteſt and loweſt Places there thou ſhalt lye for ever.</p>
                  <p>There are two Doctrines which I raiſe from the Words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe that hear the Goſpel, are exalted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven:</hi> Happy you, if you underſtand your Priviledge which at this day you enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They who will not turn to God at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-call, ſhall certainly be turned into Hell: Thou Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, who art exalted unto Heaven, ſhalt be brought down to Hell;</hi> and if Chriſt ſays it <hi>ſhall be ſo,</hi> moſt certainly it <hi>will be ſo.</hi> The firſt of theſe I ſhall but juſt touch upon, for it is the ſecond that I principally purpoſe to Proſecute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The firſt Doctrine is this; <hi>They that hear the Goſpel, are exalted unto Heaven.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is an heavenly Calling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. it comes from Heaven, and ſays to thoſe that hear it, <hi>Come up hither.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Life and Immortality is <hi>brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10. Here you have a Map of thoſe happy Regions of Light, and Love, and Joy; where there is nothing preſent that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, where there is nothing wanting that is deſirable.</p>
                  <p>2. The Goſpel plainly <hi>chalks out the way that leads to Life:</hi> Chriſt is <hi>the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. the true way to life indeed: We
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106042:188"/> have liberty to <hi>enter into the holieſt of all, by the blood of Jeſus:</hi> had it not been for his undertaking, and performance of what he undertook, there had been a <hi>flaming Sword at Heavens gate,</hi> and no fallen Man could ever have entred there. And as Chriſt, in whom we are to believe, is the way, ſo is alſo <hi>Holineſs:</hi> Chriſt by his Blood has purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the heavenly Inheritance, and has bought the Saints themſelves that are to be the Inheritors; and 'tis by his ſanctifying Spirit, by true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they are made <hi>meet for that Inheritance.</hi> The <hi>pure in Heart,</hi> and ſuch will be likewiſe pure in <hi>Life,</hi> are the <hi>bleſſed Ones</hi> that <hi>ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5. 8. and who beſides are deſirous or fit to ſee the Lord?</p>
                  <p>3. Heaven in the Goſpel is <hi>offer'd;</hi> 'tis <hi>ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, freely</hi> offer'd unto <hi>All;</hi> 'tis offer'd to the <hi>meaneſt Perſons,</hi> 'tis offer'd to the <hi>greateſt Sinners,</hi> and that without Money, without Price: 'Tis indeed too good, too great a thing for Man to purchaſe by any thing that he can give or do. Thoſe have very low thoughts of Heaven, and very high thoughts of their own Works, that think they can do enough to merit Heaven. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is the <hi>free Gift of God,</hi> not deſerved by Man; and 'tis given <hi>through Christ,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Had not Chriſt procured it, fallen Men would all have been as certainly excluded as the fallen Angels.</p>
                  <p>Briefly to Apply this.</p>
                  <p>1. Be <hi>thankful for the Goſpel,</hi> which makes the <hi>richeſt diſcovery</hi> that ever was made in this World; the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> cannot ſhew any thing comparable to a bleſſed Immortality; the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106042:188"/> from the one, the Gold from the other, are contemptible, when Heaven is named. The Goſpel tells you where is the true, the <hi>tried Gold,</hi> and of the <hi>Pearl which is of greateſt price;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Treaſure in Heaven, which neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt,</hi> nor can <hi>thieves break through and ſteal,</hi> Mat. 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Let the Kingdom of Heaven <hi>ſuffer Violence,</hi> and do you uſe an holy <hi>force to take it;</hi> here you will meet with great oppoſition; Heaven is that which occaſions the envy of Hell, becauſe of its real and eternal Excellency, and does very well deſerve your labour. Let the <hi>Treaſure</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven cauſe your <hi>Hearts</hi> to be <hi>there,</hi> ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtrait gate, hate every falſe way, becauſe it leads from Heaven, and towards De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; let the Hopes of a Crown of glory make you willing to bear the Croſs; look upon Sloth as moſt abſurd, when no leſs than Heaven will be given to them who ſhew their <hi>diligence in full aſſurance of hope unto the end:</hi> Preſs ſtill <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the mark;</hi> you cannot run too faſt for ſuch a Prize.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall ſtay on this no longer: 'Tis the ſecond Doctrine that more largely I ſhall inſiſt on.</p>

And that's this, <hi>Thoſe that will not turn to God at the Call of the Goſpel, ſhall certainly be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Hell;</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 8, 9. <hi>They that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Christ, ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>1. Diſcourſe concerning Hell, what it is, that you may the <hi>better underſtand it;</hi> and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be afraid of it.</p>
                  <p>2. I ſhall <hi>prove the Certainty</hi> of the Doctrine, that Sinners who will not turn to God, ſhall moſt ſurely be turned into Hell.</p>
                  <p>3. I ſhall Vindicate the Righteouſneſs of God, in thus dealing with, and eternally Puniſhing them that will not turn to him.</p>
                  <p>4. I ſhall conclude with the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt Place I am to Diſcourſe concerning Hell, and to ſhew you <hi>what it is.</hi> In Hell</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Deprivation of good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an <hi>Infliction of evil, pain and torment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an <hi>Eternity</hi> of both.</p>
                  <p>1. In Hell there is a <hi>Deprivation of good:</hi> All the temporal loſſes that have been ſuſtained by all the Children of Men in this World, are not comparable to the <hi>Poena Damni,</hi> Puniſhment of <hi>loſs,</hi> which one Sinner in Hell ſhall undergoe: Several things thoſe in Hell are deprived of.</p>
                  <p>1. They are deprived of <hi>all that Love, and Grace, and Mercy that is in God:</hi> The Pſalmiſt that knew by experience the excellency of God's Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, affirms 'tis <hi>better than Life,</hi> Pſal. 63. 3. His Mercys are <hi>tender,</hi> and a <hi>multitude,</hi> and <hi>ſure</hi> to the Veſſels of Mercy. How were thoſe fill'd with admiration, and with a ſenſe of their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <hi>Who in times paſt were not a People,</hi> but were made <hi>the People of God; who had not obtained Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> but after <hi>did obtain Mercy,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 10. But alas, tho God be <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8. he hath no Love for them that are in Hell, they lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106042:189"/> his Wrath and Hatred, and both are unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably fixt upon them: Though the Lord does delight in ſhewing Mercy, yet his Bowels do not at all ſtir or move towards the Damned; though they lye in extreameſt Woe, and are continually <hi>weeping and wailing,</hi> yet their Tears <hi>draw not</hi> forth his <hi>Compaſſions:</hi> He has <hi>caſt them off for ever,</hi> and will be <hi>favourable no more;</hi> he has <hi>forgotten to be gracious,</hi> and in implacable, but righteous Anger, has <hi>ſhut up his tender Mercies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. They that are in Hell, are deprived <hi>of the beatifical Viſion of God:</hi> The door of Heaven they found ſhut againſt them, when they ſaid, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us!</hi> and 'twill never be opened: They ſhall never be ſuffered to <hi>ſee him face to face,</hi> but be always excluded from his Preſence. What Happineſs is there in <hi>ſeeing God!</hi> how tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and ſatisfying is this ſight! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. ult. <hi>As for me, I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> But the Damned are not, never ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch a View; they are baniſhed that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Preſence, where there is fulneſs of joy, and where there are pleaſures for evermore:</hi> God has <hi>fixt a great gulph</hi> between himſelf and them, and through that 'tis impoſſible for them <hi>to paſs,</hi> Luk. 16. 26.</p>
                  <p>3. They in Hell are deprived of <hi>all hopes by a Mediator:</hi> Our Lord tells us, That he <hi>came not into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved;</hi> and has given a large Commiſſion <hi>to Preach the Goſpel,</hi> to offer that Grace and Salvation whereof he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>to every Creature,</hi> Mark 16. 15. The Lord Jeſus now encourages all to come to him, that

                  <p>4. They in Hell are deprived <hi>of the glory of the new Jeruſalem:</hi> 'Tis a mighty loſs, to loſe ſuch a <hi>weighty thing</hi> as a <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17. Suppoſe a Rich Man, worth Millions, ſhould break, and not be worth a Farthing; ſuppoſe all the Kings and Emperors breathing, ſhould loſe their Crowns in one day, this would be but a petty Loſs, compared with the loſs of a Crown of Life: In Heaven there is ſuch a Crown, and the Damned might have had it, if they had but valued it; but alas! that Crown they muſt never wear: In Heaven there is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where they in Hell muſt never reign: When they ſee what they have loſe, and how fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wilfully, and for the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>2. As in Hell there is a Deprivation of good, ſo there is an <hi>Infliction of evil, pain and torment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. There is in Hell <hi>great torment in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> A wounded Conſcience in <hi>this World</hi> has been found intolerable. <hi>Spira,</hi> he ſignifies that Racks, Gibbets, Flames of Martyrdom, were nothing to what he felt, and in a Pang of Deſpair attempts Self-murthering; but being hindred, he breaks out into Blaſphemy, <hi>I wiſh I were above God, for I know he will not have Mercy on me:</hi> here was Hells lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in his Mouth, and much of Hell-torment in his Heart. <hi>Judas</hi> his Conſcience was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could he bear it? No, he becomes his own Executioner, with his own hand ends his Life, and ſends his Soul to <hi>his appointed place:</hi> And yet the torment of Conſcience in this World, is but the <hi>Praludium,</hi> the beginning of ſorrows. Every Conſcience in Hell will be <hi>thoroughly awake,</hi> and keep it ſelf <hi>for ever waking;</hi> it will be <hi>exactly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;</hi> not a Sin that has been Committed all the life-time, but will have made a Wound in the Conſcience; and not a Wound but will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably ſmarting, without hope of any eaſe. Conſcience will be in a perpetual Agony, in this Agony 'twill rage, and raging it will reproach the Damned: It will tell them of their preſumptuous ſinning, of their rejecting Chriſt, their neglecting great Salvation, and how all <hi>its cheeking</hi> of them was <hi>in vain:</hi> And now 'tis incurably wounded, it can never be quiet, but they ſhall always find it

                  <p>3. There will in Hell be torment in <hi>Sinners Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories:</hi> I wiſh that none of you that hear me this day, may in that place of Woe, remember the <hi>Warning now given you,</hi> to your <hi>Confuſion,</hi> becauſe you <hi>would not take it;</hi> heark what was ſaid, <hi>Luk. 16. 25. Son, remember thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and Lazarus evil things; but now he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106042:191"/> is comforted, and thou art tormented:</hi> Really the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what he <hi>had,</hi> what he <hi>was,</hi> and what he <hi>did</hi> on Earth, was in Hell very tormenting to this wretched Rich Man. The Damned <hi>there,</hi> will remember their delicious Fare, and how ſenſual and bruitiſh they were in pleaſing of their Appetites; they will remember the time they ſpent in Adorning of themſelves, taking much Pains to dreſs and trick the Carkaſs, but no Pains at all to purge the Heart; they will remember their Feaſts, their Mirth, their carnal Jollity, which quite ſtupified their Hearts, and baniſhed all thoughts and care about another World and Eternity; they will remember all the <hi>Mercies</hi> they enjoyed, which they did nothing but abuſe to their <hi>own harm,</hi> as well as to the <hi>diſhonour of that God</hi> who gave them.</p>
                  <p>Above all, they will remember <hi>what Pains were taken to have prevented their Deſtruction:</hi> The Lord was <hi>unwilling they ſhould Periſh,</hi> but <hi>Death</hi> was that which <hi>themſelves</hi> preferr'd before <hi>Life.</hi> Oh how long did Chriſt come, Sabbath after Sabbath, and <hi>knock at the door,</hi> but they would not open! How often did the Spirit ſtrive with them, to ſtop them in Hells road, and to turn them into the way of Peace, but they were <hi>ſtiff-necked,</hi> and <hi>always reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> They will remember their <hi>Preachers</hi> Pains and Prayers, and labour and travel of Soul; how they lifted up their Voices, to awaken them out of their Sin and Security; how they intreated them to be reconciled to God, and to turn into the ſafe and bleſſed Paths of Righteouſneſs; but they were Deaf and obſtinate, nothing would prevail with them, and the remembrance of all this will be <hi>bitter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>4. In Hell there will be torment in <hi>the Body and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106042:192"/> the Members of it,</hi> and ſuch as no body ever felt, or was capable of bearing here on Earth: The Stone, the Cholick and the Strangury, the greateſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever the hand of Man inflicted, are no more comparable to the Pains of Hell, than the ſmalleſt Prick of a Pin is to a Dagger that ſtrikes quite through, and gives the Heart a deadly Wound. The Senſes of the Damned ſhall have that which will be exceedingly afflicting: What woful Spectacles will their <hi>Eyes</hi> behold! What diſmal Noyſes will fill their <hi>Ears!</hi> how fierce and unquenchable are the Flames that they ſhall <hi>feel! all their parts</hi> ſhall be in pain, not ſo much as <hi>one</hi> free: The whole Body was defiled, and at Sins ſervice, all the Members were yielded as <hi>inſtruments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs;</hi> 'tis but righteous that all ſhould be Puniſhed. Why are the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the Wicked <hi>raiſed</hi> at the laſt day? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may bear their part in the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the whole Man by Sin has deſerved. This Reſurrection is certain, but 'tis a dreadful Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is a <hi>Reſurrection to Damnation,</hi> Joh. 5. 29.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Torments you may well ſuppoſe that <hi>Death</hi> will be wiſht for, and that the Damned would <hi>rejoyce if they could find a Grave;</hi> but alas, after the Reſurrection, the <hi>firſt Death</hi> is no more. The Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a ſad ſenſe do put on Incorruption and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, they can never dye and ceaſe to feel their Pains; they muſt always live a Life ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe than Death, and there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. O you Wicked Men! where's your <hi>true Love</hi> to your <hi>Bodies,</hi> that you ſeem to be ſo tender of? I beſeech you mind your <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>love your Bodies bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> than by Sin to expoſe them to the Vengeance of eternal Fire. You ſee how in Hell there is a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of good,</hi> an <hi>Infliction of evil, pain and torment:</hi> I add,</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106042:192"/>
                  <p>3. In Hell there is <hi>an Eternity of both,</hi> the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will be without <hi>Hope of Reſtitution;</hi> and the Torment will be without <hi>any end,</hi> without the <hi>leaſt Mitigation.</hi> Eternity is an amazing word; the thing it ſelf much more amazing Who can ſee to the end of Eternity! who can ſee half way into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! <hi>Time</hi> is continually <hi>paſſing;</hi> but Eternity never in the leaſt <hi>ſpends:</hi> 'tis not capable of any <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> after <hi>myriads of Ages,</hi> 'tis ſtill as <hi>bulky</hi> and <hi>whole</hi> as ever. If Hell were Ten thouſand times hotter than it is, yet were it but a <hi>Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and at laſt to end, 'twould be <hi>Nothing</hi> in compariſon. But ſince thoſe that are thrown into it, muſt lye in it for ever, Hells Eternity is the very Hell of Hell. In Eternity, whether of <hi>Joy</hi> or <hi>Woe,</hi> there is <hi>tota ſimul &amp; perfecta poſſeſſio,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> of it <hi>perfectly</hi> poſſeſs'd at <hi>once.</hi> Hell is not <hi>parcel'd out</hi> unto the Damned, but they continually feel the <hi>whole of it.</hi> This is terrible; there is not the leaſt part of the puniſhment, that ever they are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from undergoing: but 'tis much more terrible, that their Suffering muſt be <hi>always,</hi> and never have a Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Divines have ſtretch'd their Wits to repreſent Eternity, that apprehenſions of it might be more ſuitable and affecting, but were never able to reach it. We can no more comprehend Eternity, than a Nut-ſhell can contain the whole Ocean. Suppoſe that all this World were fill'd with <hi>Sand,</hi> from the Earths Centre round, and up to the <hi>higheſt Heaven;</hi> and <hi>once</hi> in a <hi>Thouſand Years,</hi> one <hi>ſingle Sand</hi> ſhould be taken away: How ſad would it be to lye in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the <hi>whole vast heap</hi> were gone! But after ſo many Millions and Millions of Years, for the Damned to be every whit <hi>as far from the End of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106042:193"/> their Miſery,</hi> as they were the <hi>very firſt moment</hi> they began to feel it; here <hi>all words fall ſhort,</hi> and I muſt conclude in <hi>Astoniſhment!</hi> Do not think that theſe are <hi>frightful things invented</hi> by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> to <hi>ſcare</hi> you into <hi>better manners.</hi> When we warn and tell you of the Eternity of Hells puniſhment, we ſpeak the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth of the Eternal God.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, I am to prove the Doctrine; That <hi>they who will not turn to God, ſhall moſt certainly be turned into Hell.</hi> The Arguments to prove this, are theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt ſhall be drawn from the <hi>Wrath of God.</hi> This is <hi>revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouneſs of Men,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. They that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to turn, and yet refuſe, that Wrath abides upon them ſtill; unbelief and impenitency bindes, as it were all their Sins faſt upon them, and they muſt needs remain under Wrath alſo, <hi>Joh. 3. ult. He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Nay, Wrath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being appeaſed, is increaſed, by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Goſpel-offer of Gods favour and mercy in Chriſt. And where will unpacified Wrath at length iſſue? See <hi>Deut. 32. 22. A Fire is kindled in mine Anger, and it ſhall burn to the loweſt Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. A ſecond Argument ſhall be drawn from the <hi>Truth of God.</hi> He has threatned Hell for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of unconverted Sinners, <hi>Pſal. 9. 17. The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God:</hi> Let there be never ſo many of them, Hell has room enough to hold them, and their multitude will not be any Security. The Truth of God is engaged to make good <hi>all his promiſes</hi> to the Faithful, and alſo <hi>all his threatnings</hi> to the Wicked.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106042:193"/> A man muſt believe the Promiſes in order to the accompliſhment of them: But tho the Threatnings are dis-believed, they will be fulfilled; and the <hi>greater</hi> the unbelief, the <hi>more certainly</hi> and <hi>ſorely</hi> will they overtake, and lay hold on the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is to be credited when he ſpeaks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a God that <hi>cannot Lye;</hi> but when he adds his <hi>Oath</hi> to his word, what he ſayes is the <hi>more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to be aſſented to. His <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by an Oath, and when <hi>he could Swear by no greater, he Swore by himſelf.</hi> And his Oath alſo confirms his <hi>Threatnings of Wrath,</hi> Heb. 3. 18, 19. <hi>And to whom Swear he that they ſhould not enter into his Reſt, but to them that believed not? So we ſee that they could not enter in becauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Another Argument to prove, that unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sinners ſhall be turned into Hell, ſhall be drawn <hi>from their preſent Impunity.</hi> Eſcaping now ſcot-free, we may conclude the greater certainty of a future reckoning. They that will not turn to God, we ſee that many of them are in Health, at eaſe, enjoy peace and plenty, and Sentence againſt their evil works being not <hi>now</hi> executed, and they hereupon being fully ſet to do Evil; 'tis reaſonable to believe there will be, and 'tis very Righteous there ſhould be a terrible Sentence of Condemnation, and that Sentence put in Execution upon them in the other World.</p>
                  <p>4. They that will not turn to God at the Goſpel call, ſhall be turned into Hell, for <hi>they ſlight the only Saviour.</hi> Chriſt calls himſelf a <hi>Door;</hi> ſo he <hi>has been,</hi> from the beginning of the World; ſo he <hi>will be</hi> to the End of it. There is <hi>no Door</hi> through which <hi>Hell</hi> can be <hi>eſcaped,</hi> but this. Unconverted Sinners <hi>will not come to Him that they may have Life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106042:194"/> therefore they are unavoidably Siezed by eternal Death. <hi>Corruptible things, as Silver and Gold,</hi> they know how to value, but the <hi>precious Blood of Chriſt</hi> is not prized, and not being Sprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt <hi>our Paſſover, who was Sacrificed for us;</hi> the Deſtroyer has power over them, and they fall into eternal Predition.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I am to vindicate the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God in thus dealing with, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally puniſhing them that will not turn to Him: And here,</p>
                  <p>1. Let the <hi>Majeſty and greatneſs of God</hi> be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>againſt whom all Sin is committed.</hi> How much greater a Crime is it to ſtrike a Prince upon the Throne, than to ſtrike a Peaſant! How much is Sin <hi>greatned,</hi> being committed againſt the <hi>Higheſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of all,</hi> who is infinitely Superiour to all other Powers, <hi>Pſal. 104. 1. O Lord, my God, thou art ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, thou art Cloathed with Honour and with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty!</hi> Pſal. 145. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed, and his greatneſs is unſearchable.</hi> Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of a Law, enacted by the King of Heaven; and is indeed a diſowning of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority, as if he had no right to rule the Sinner. Think of the <hi>infinite diſtance</hi> between the <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>offended,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> that is the <hi>Offender,</hi> and how <hi>much</hi> Sin <hi>offends;</hi> for it diſowns his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſtrikes at his very <hi>Being;</hi> for the Sinner <hi>wiſhes</hi> there were <hi>no God</hi> to be ſubject to. I ſay, think of all this, and you will perceive that Sin deſerves everlaſting Puniſhment. The carnal Mind thinks Hell <hi>too much</hi> for a Sinner to feel, becauſe it <hi>meaſures God</hi> by it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and thinks <hi>too little</hi> of the Glorious <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106042:194"/>
                  <p>2. Sinners can <hi>never by all that they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſatisfie for their Iniquities;</hi> therefore their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in Hell is juſtly endleſs: No <hi>meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> can make ſatisfaction for Sin. If Chriſt the Mediatour, had not been over all <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> by his Death and all his Sufferings, he would never have <hi>made Peace.</hi> His <hi>God-head</hi> put a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>infinite value</hi> upon the <hi>price</hi> he <hi>paid,</hi> and made it <hi>ſufficient</hi> for our Redemption. The Damned in Hell cannot ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for their Tranſgreſſions; therefore they juſtly are kept eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Priſoners there. It is above <hi>five Thouſand Years ago,</hi> that the <hi>Evil Angels</hi> were caſt down to Hell; by the puniſhment they have undergone, have <hi>they made any Satisfaction</hi> for their offences? No, no, ſtill they have continued in their Enmity, and deſerved more puniſhment. And from Satans utte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alienation from God and all goodneſs, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that Hell is not a place to mend any; but Sin is hight'ned; thoſe that were bad on Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe in Hell, and are unalterably confirm'd in Evil.</p>
                  <p>3. The puniſhment of Sin in Hell is juſtly Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becauſe Sin is <hi>inſatiable.</hi> Suppoſe a Sinner could live in this World to Eternity, there is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough in his Nature, to make him an <hi>Offender of God unto Eternity.</hi> If he were an <hi>everlaſting Liver</hi> upon Earth, he would be an everlaſting Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. If the Carnal Heart would but ſpeak out, that would be its Language: <hi>I would deſire no other, no greater happineſs, than that I might live here for ever, that I might Sin here for ever.</hi> This inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Nature of Sin, this inclination and deſire of the Sinner, is known to the Heart-ſearcher; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the puniſhment he inflicts is very Righteous, tho 'tis everlaſting.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:106042:195"/>
                  <p>4. For the Vindication of the Righteouſneſs of God, take notice <hi>what has been offered unto Sinners, and rejected. Chriſt</hi> is offered; his juſtifying <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> his <hi>unſearchable Riches;</hi> all <hi>his Fulneſs;</hi> all the Benefits which he has purchaſed at ſo dear a Price, and yet the offer is made light of. How much is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd, when Chriſt is Contemn'd! and how much of Sin is there in the Contempt! The bleſſed God in the Glorious Goſpel, does call to Sinners to turn to him; and what does he offer? His own all-ſufficient-ſelf. <hi>I my ſelf am yours, if you will turn to me, and become ſincerely mine. I will be a God to you, all my attributes ſhall be for you: I will be your Shield, and your exceeding great Reward, and your Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever!</hi> Now for a Sinner to turn a Deaf Ear to all this, is ſuch a Sin, as does deſerve the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal loſs</hi> of what is offer'd; and the feeling of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Wrath is juſt, ſince ſuch infinite and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goodneſs has been deſpiſed. I might alſo add, that the Sinner is <hi>told of this Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before-hand;</hi> therefore if his Luſts are ſo dear, that he will venture to be Damned, rather than part with them, when thoſe Luſts that War againſt his Soul have quite undone him, and brought him down to Hell indeed, he cannot charge God with Injuſtice; but he muſt blame himſelf, becauſe when warned of Hell and Wrath, he would not fear and Flee from it.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the <hi>Applacation.</hi> I begin with ſome Inferences, that may be drawn from the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. If Sinners that will not turn, ſhall be brought down to Hell; certainly <hi>Sin is another kind of thing than is commonly imagined.</hi> Oh Sin! how much art thou
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106042:195"/> miſtaken! Thou art very little underſtood on Earth! In Heaven thou art better underſtood by Saints, and full glad they are they are quite rid of thee! In Hell thou art better underſtood by Sinners, and they muſt Groan for ever under the weight of thee! O all of you, Study Hell more, if you would know Sin more fully. Gods ſeverity towards Man for Sin, argues it a very vaſt Evil. I am perſwaded, that all the Men upon Earth, that <hi>all the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven,</hi> ſince they cannot <hi>comprehend</hi> the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of God,</hi> neither can they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>all the Evil</hi> that is in Sin: And if God alone does <hi>fully underſtand how Evil Sin is,</hi> he alone is the <hi>competent Judge</hi> what <hi>Puniſhment is due to it. O exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinful Sin!</hi> Rom. 7. 13. thou canſt not be called by ſo bad a Name, as thy own is!</p>
                  <p>2. Learn from hence the <hi>Miſery of unconverted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Are there none unconverted here? I wiſh there were not. Are there not many unconverted in this place? I fear there are. Seriouſly conſider in what State you are. You walk upon the <hi>Brink of Hell;</hi> you <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> upon the <hi>Brink of Hell;</hi> in your <hi>Shops,</hi> at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> you are ſtill upon the <hi>Brink of Hell;</hi> when you lye down at Night, you <hi>Sleep</hi> upon the <hi>Brink of Hell.</hi> Oh <hi>what Hearts</hi> are yours, that you can <hi>Sleep ſecurely!</hi> Is ſuch a perilous State to be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in? In ſuch danger, and <hi>depths of Miſery,</hi> how ſhould you cry to the Lord for mercy, <hi>Pſal. 130. 1. Davids</hi> words are proper for a Sinner to make uſe of, <hi>Pſal. 51. 1. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy loving kindneſs, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my Tranſgreſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Hence I infer, That they who refuſe to turn to God, are <hi>certainly beſides themſelves,</hi> elſe the broken Ciſterns would not draw them away from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106042:196"/> of living waters; and a little gain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, would not make them venture to lye in Flames unquenchable. God ſayes, Turn ye, turn ye! Will you turn, or will ye not? If you will, you ſhall live; if you won't, where are your Wits? You are out of them in the worſt Senſe of all. The Lord now ſayes, <hi>Turn,</hi> if ye will not hear and obey, at laſt he will ſay <hi>Depart,</hi> and that word you <hi>muſt obey,</hi> and be forced away from him into everlaſting Burnings.</p>
                  <p>4. Shall Sinners be turned into Hell; then their <hi>Proſperity is not to be envied or admired.</hi> It has been a Cuſtom in ſome places, to grant to condemn'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, a Liberty to enjoy their Pleaſures and Delights a few days before their Execution; but alas, what did theſe ſignifie to them that were to dye a few days after? A <hi>fit Repreſentation</hi> of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wicked! They are perhaps gaudily Cloathed, and daintily Fed, and have <hi>more than Heart could wiſh:</hi> But this proſperity is very ſhort; they ſtand in <hi>ſlippery Places,</hi> and quickly fall; <hi>they are brought to Deſtruction as in a moment, and utterly conſumed with Terrours,</hi> Pſal. 73. 18, 19. The ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do very much <hi>need</hi> our <hi>pity;</hi> but nothing that they have is <hi>worth</hi> our <hi>Envy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Hence I inferr the <hi>happineſs of ſincere Converts.</hi> Many temporal Evils may be their exerciſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but Hells eternal Torments they ſhall never feel, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Whatever the <hi>Times</hi> are; <hi>in Eternity,</hi> and <hi>to Eternity,</hi> it will be well with them. If Hell were Ranſack't all over, you might find Profeſſours, Preachers, Princes, Nobles there; you might find worldly Wiſe, and worldly wealthy a great many, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106042:196"/> not <hi>one true Convert</hi> among the <hi>whole Number.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are reconciled to God by the Blood of Chriſt, and are ſafe and happy. Hell is a dreadful place, and has a very wide <hi>Door;</hi> but who has the <hi>Key of it?</hi> The Key is not in <hi>Satans,</hi> but in <hi>Christ</hi>'s keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Rev. 1. 18. I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore,</hi> Amen, <hi>and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</hi> He will open the Door of Death, that Converts Bodies may come out of the Grave; he will keep the door of Hell faſt ſhut, that Converts ſhall never be thrown in thither.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Remembrance of Hell, will be a <hi>great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the Tempter.</hi> Evil Angels are great Enemies to the good Word of God; eſpecally they are diſpleaſed at Sermons concerning <hi>Chrſt</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:106042:197"/> they are unwilling that Men ſhould know the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> Sin has brought them in danger of; unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they ſhould hear of a <hi>Saviour and Deliverer.</hi> Think of <hi>Hell</hi> whenever you find the <hi>Devil</hi> temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. He endeavours to hide <hi>Hell</hi> from your Eyes, that he may lead you ſecure thither. Satan tells the <hi>Intemperate</hi> Man, that makes himſelf a Beaſt by exceſſive Drinking; that this is the way to Exhile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and chear his Spirits, a Remedy againſt care and ſorrow, and a means to make him merry. But he would not have the Drunkard think of <hi>Hell,</hi> nor of <hi>the dreadful Cup of</hi> Gods <hi>indignation without mixture,</hi> that will be put into his hand at the laſt day. Satan tells the defrauding, over reaching <hi>Knave,</hi> that he will be a great <hi>Gainer</hi> by his Subtlety; but he <hi>hides Hell</hi> from him, where none of his <hi>Gain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> and where <hi>eternal happineſs,</hi> and an <hi>immortal Soul</hi> are <hi>lost for ever.</hi> Satan tells the <hi>filthy Wretch,</hi> of the pleaſures to be found in the embraces of the well-favoured Harlot; but this he conceals; that going <hi>to her Houſe,</hi> his <hi>Feet go down to Death,</hi> and <hi>his Steps will</hi> ſoon <hi>take hold on Hell.</hi> It would be Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in you, and in all, to ſee how <hi>Sin and Hell are joyned together.</hi> It would make the Tempter loſe his labour; if you would ever remember, that in <hi>Tempting</hi> you to Sin, he does in effect only <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade</hi> to be <hi>willing for ever to be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The ſerious conſideration of <hi>Hell,</hi> will <hi>quicken you to cry for Mercy.</hi> Upon the <hi>Sight</hi> of <hi>Hells miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> how deſirable will <hi>Mercy</hi> be in your Eyes!

                  <p>4.

                  <p>1. If you would eſcape Hell, <hi>think of Hell, the

If <hi>Sin had never entred into the World,</hi> none in the World would have been turned into Hell; if neither Men nor Angels had ſinn'd againſt God, there would have been no ſuch thing as Hell in being.

Oh ceaſe thy <hi>loving the World, and the things that are in the World!</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. Will any Sin that rules in thee, and that thou art willingly ſubject to, <hi>reign unto Death,</hi> and ruine thee for ever?

                  <p>2. If you would eſcape Hell, take notice how <hi>the door of Hope is open to the very worſt of you:</hi> Thoſe that are gone far in Hells road, and are within a ſtep of the burning Lake, tis poſſible for <hi>them</hi> to be catched as <hi>firebrands out of the burning.</hi> The door is open to day, I adviſe you to enter preſently; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>aſſure you</hi> 'twill <hi>ſtand open</hi> 'till to morrow; <hi>While

Though you are <hi>fallen by your Iniquities,</hi> yet if you will <hi>Now</hi> return to the Lord, there is hope for the very worſt of you; paſt Sins ſhall all be buried, if there be a preſent Converſion. <hi>Redemption is plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and that ſhould abundantly encourage all to Hope and Turn, <hi>Pſal. 130. 7, 8. Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is plenteous redemption, and he ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. If you would eſcape Hell, <hi>you muſt be ſure to look unto Jeſus:</hi> Lord Jeſus! <hi>Turn every Eye to thee, and cauſe every Heart to open and receive thee!</hi> Thoſe that were <hi>ſtung</hi> with the <hi>fiery</hi> Serpents, liv'd notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if they <hi>lookt unto the brazen Serpent:</hi> Thoſe that are in danger of Hell, and have very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it, ſhall be delivered from it, if by Faith they look to Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 45. 22.

                  <p>IN the foregoing Chapter, the Apoſtle diſcourſes concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the <hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> He declares at large the wonderful and glorious effects that this Faith produced in the Saints under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: By Faith theſe Believers denyed themſelves; by Faith they Conquered the whole World, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its fierceſt Perſecutions; deſpiſing all its Wealth, all its Pleaſures, all its Glory, <hi>and confeſſed they were ſtrangers and ſojourners on the Earth:</hi> By Faith they <hi>ſaw Him that is inviſible,</hi> and looked <hi>for a City that that hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this Verſe where my Text lies, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle applyes unto thoſe believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> to whom he writes, what he had ſpoken concerning their <hi>faithful Fore-fathers:</hi> Theſe are called a <hi>Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:</hi> Witneſſes they were, concerning what? tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the <hi>Vanity</hi> of all things that are ſeen, that are but <hi>temporal:</hi> Witneſſes concerning the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of thoſe things that are not ſeen, which are <hi>eternal.</hi> They are ſtyled a <hi>Cloud,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>greatneſs of their Number;</hi> and perhaps there may be ſome alluſion to the <hi>Cloud</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that <hi>guided Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan:</hi> For though our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was <hi>typified</hi> by <hi>that Cloud,</hi> and he is the <hi>unerring Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Example</hi> whom we are bound to follow; yet in Scripture we are adviſed alſo to follow <hi>the foot-ſtepts of the Flock;</hi> and in this very Epiſtle, to be <hi>followers of them who through Faith and Patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Promiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:106042:199"/>
                  <p>The Courſe of a Chriſtian in this World is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Race;</hi> this Race muſt be <hi>run,</hi> that the Prize at the end of it may be obtained; and that we may run it the better, we are <hi>removere prohibens,</hi> to remove Impediments, to lay aſide <hi>every Weight,</hi> and the <hi>Sin that does ſo eaſily beſet us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Words I have read, there are three things obſervable.</p>
                  <p>1. Here is an <hi>Intimation</hi> of a <hi>Danger,</hi> and that is from <hi>Sin:</hi> Sin and Danger are inſeparable; how can it chuſe but be prejudicial to him that's guilty of it! you may as well imagine <hi>Hell</hi> to be without <hi>Pain,</hi> as <hi>Sin</hi> to be without <hi>Peril.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The greateſt danger is from the Sin that does moſt eaſily beſet us; 'tis called by the Holy Ghoſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Sin that hangs faſteſt about us: Some by this underſtand <hi>Original Sin,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation and Corruption of Nature; ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the carnal and enſnaring <hi>Fear of Man:</hi> The Apoſtle arms the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Saints againſt this, and would have them couragious, and if called to it, <hi>reſiſt even to blood, ſtriving againſt ſin.</hi> But by the Sin that does moſt eaſily beſet us, we may underſtand any ſin that does ſo: Yet when we take notice of the <hi>Maſter-ſin,</hi> which is moſt apt to prevail, we ſhould by all means <hi>trace it</hi> to its <hi>Original,</hi> and take notice of the corrupt Fountain from which this ſtrong and filthy Stream proceeds.</p>
                  <p>3. Here is the way how to be <hi>ſecured from Danger,</hi> by laying aſide <hi>every weight,</hi> and eſpecially the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the <hi>heavieſt Clogg of all,</hi> the Sin that does moſt eaſily beſet us. Caſt away <hi>every tranſgreſſion, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine;</hi> but eſpecially that which naturally you <hi>love beſt</hi> and <hi>more than all,</hi> becauſe <hi>this, this,</hi> is moſt of all pernicious and deſtructive.</p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:106042:200"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> The Doctrine which I raiſe from the words is this. <hi>Though all ſin is to be caſt away, the Maſter-ſin eſpecially is to be abandoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Prove that <hi>all Sin</hi> is to be caſt away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew you how the <hi>Maſter ſin</hi> may be <hi>known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Produce the Reaſons, why <hi>this</hi> in a <hi>ſpecial</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is to be <hi>forſaken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the laſt place make <hi>Application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place I am to prove that <hi>every ſin</hi> ſhould be caſt away; and the Argument to convince you of this, is in the Verſe where my Text lies. Every Sin is a <hi>weight,</hi> and a moſt unreaſonable thing it is, that Men ſhould be fond of that which is burthenſome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. The weightineſs of Sin, I ſhall demonſtrate in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. Sin is a weight to <hi>a ſoftned and ſenſible ſoul;</hi> though a ſtupid Tranſgreſſor feels Sin no more than a ſtone does a Mountain, that lies upon it; yet when once the Heart of Stone is turned into a Heart of Fleſh, Sin preſently becomes very burthenſome. He that has a <hi>new Heart and a new Spirit</hi> given him, will have <hi>new</hi> and <hi>other</hi> apprehenſions of Sin, he will look upon Sin with ſorrow, and himſelf with ſelf-abhorrency, <hi>Ezek. 36. 26, 31. A new Heart will I give you, a new Spirit will I put within you. Then ſhall ye remember your evil wayes and your doings that have not been good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities and your abominations. David</hi> could not make light of ſin, when once convinced of its evil by the Spirit; he grieves becauſe he had offended God; he fears his wrath that he had deſerved; and earneſtly implores compaſſion and favour. His Sin lay very hard upon him, <hi>Pſal. 38. 4, 6. Mine iniquities are gone over my head,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106042:200"/> as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me; I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Sin is a weight unto <hi>the damned in Hell:</hi> that 'tis ſo, I know; but <hi>how</hi> weighty, I cannot expreſs, no mind on Earth is able to conceive. Sin is the weight which has ſunk all the Souls that are there into that place of Wo; and becauſe ſin will ly upon them for ever, they ſhall never be able to riſe up under it. In Hell there is a full, a general, an everlaſting Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that <hi>ſin is heavy.</hi> If we could diſcourſe with the <hi>rich</hi> Man, who as the Goſpel tells us is in Hell, and <hi>ask him,</hi> whether his Gluttony, Pride, contempt of God, hatred of Holineſs, are <hi>light</hi> or <hi>weighty?</hi> Oh! <hi>what</hi> would that <hi>Tongue</hi> that cryed out for a <hi>drop of Water,</hi> anſwer to ſuch a queſtion? Surely none in Hell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n make light of ſin which brought them thither.</p>
                  <p>3. Sin is a weight which <hi>burthens the whole Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Hard-hearted <hi>Man groans not</hi> under it, when the <hi>whole Creation beſides</hi> does. The <hi>Creatures were made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope,</hi> Rom. 8. 20. and <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ow that the whole Creation groaneth and travelleth in pain toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even until now.</hi> And all theſe travelling pains, they are the effects of Sin. <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Book of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes,</hi> uſes ſeveral very ſignificant expreſſions: <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is vaniny;</hi> and <hi>all things are full of labour; Man cannot utter it.</hi> And again, there <hi>are many things that increaſe vanity.</hi> When Sin entred into the World it made a <hi>ſad alteration</hi> in it, well may the Creatures groan under it; and though their pains are terrible, <hi>pains of travel;</hi> yet becauſe <hi>ſuch pains,</hi> they are <hi>hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and will iſſue in a <hi>reſtauration,</hi> which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, for God has ſaid it. He has told us thus much, that the <hi>Creature ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106042:201"/> Corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 21. But the manner of this Reſtauration, he has not told us: Gods <hi>ſilence</hi> ſhould repreſs <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Curioſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Sin was found a Weight <hi>by Jeſus the Mediator.</hi> He undertook (and 'twas well for us he did) to bear this Burthen, and <hi>no Shoulders</hi> but his could have born it; but when he bore it, how did he groan under it! This put him into an <hi>Agony,</hi> this made him <hi>Sweat,</hi> and Sweat <hi>drops of Blood.</hi> This made him cry out, <hi>my Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death: And, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Oh! bleſſed Saviour, <hi>what extorted ſuch cryes as theſe from Thee?</hi> Oh! Sinner, <hi>It was thy Sin, and the Sins of all others whom I ſave, that lay ſo hard upon Me,</hi> Iſa. 53. 6. <hi>All we like Sheep,</hi> ſayes the Prophet, <hi>have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> If the Man Chriſt Jeſus had not been the Eternal Son of God, he could never have born ſuch an heavy Load, as all the Sins of his whole Church laid upon him at once all together.</p>
                  <p>5. God <hi>himſelf complains of Sin as a weighty thing,</hi> which <hi>He</hi> is very <hi>weary of,</hi> Iſa. 43. 24. <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy Sins, and haſt wearied me with thine Iniquities.</hi> And, Amos 2. 13. <hi>Behold I am preſſed under you, as a Cart is preſſed that is full of Sheaves.</hi> Sin is a Burthen to the Almighty, tho he be ſo rich and abundant in Forbearance and Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Nay, Sin will make <hi>Duties</hi> to be a Burthen to Him, <hi>Iſa. 1. 13, 14. Bring no more vain Oblations, your Sabbaths and calling of Aſſemblies, I cannot away with, it is Iniquity even the Solemn Meeting. Your new Moons, and your appointed Feasts, my Soul hateth; they are a Trouble to me, I am weary to bear them.</hi> And 'tis obſervable, when the Lord comes to a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106042:201"/> to <hi>puniſh</hi> Sinners, becauſe of their Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, He ſpeaks as One about to <hi>eaſe himſelf</hi> of a <hi>Load,</hi> Iſa. 1. 24. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts, the mighty one of Iſrael: Ah! I will eaſe me of my Adverſaries, and avenge me of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> If Sin be thus a Weight, I adviſe all to be weary, and beg to be eaſed of it. He is a ſenſeleſs Fool indeed, who makes a Mock of Sin, and ſtill goes on to add unto his own Burthen.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place. I ſhall ſhew you <hi>how the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Sin may be known:</hi> And here I would premiſe theſe three things:</p>
                  <p>1. All Sin that is <hi>allowed of,</hi> may truly be ſaid <hi>to Reign,</hi> where 'tis allowed. A Man that wilfully continues in the Commiſſion of any Sin, is certainly the Servant of it, whatever it be. 'Tis the Miſery of the unregenerate, that they have, <hi>tot Dominos quot vitia,</hi> ſo many <hi>Luſts,</hi> ſo many <hi>Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There is in many Perſons a <hi>particular</hi> Sin, <hi>which does prevail more than any other.</hi> In the Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there are all the Humours, yet <hi>One</hi> commonly is <hi>Predominant,</hi> and the Denomination is from <hi>that.</hi> Thus 'tis in the Body of Sin; tho there is a Maſs of all Corruption; yet there may be ſome ſpecial Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that has the greateſt ſtrength and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. This in Scripture is called, the <hi>ſweet</hi> Sin, in which the greateſt delight is taken, compared to a <hi>ſweet Morſel</hi> under the Tongue, <hi>Job 20. 12, 13. Tho wickedneſs is ſweet in his Mouth, tho he hide it under his Tongue, tho he ſpare it and forſake it not;</hi> yet at laſt it proves extremely bitter, deadly as the <hi>very Gall of Aſps within him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. There are ſome in whom <hi>ſeveral Sins are ſo Predominant,</hi> that 'tis hard to determine which is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106042:202"/> 
                     <hi>most Maſter.</hi> Some have ſo <hi>hot</hi> an <hi>Anger,</hi> and ſo <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>furious</hi> a <hi>Luſt,</hi> that you cannot ſo eaſily judge, which of theſe is hotteſt. Nay, in ſome, Sins that ſeem very <hi>contrary</hi> one to another, yet in ſeveral reſpects they will both prevail. Many a Man is liberal and <hi>profuſe,</hi> as to his <hi>Ornaments</hi> and <hi>Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> he ſpends freely in the Sumptuous furniſhing of his Table; Hand and Purſe are open, if he be in <hi>Riotous Company.</hi> Yet if you ask this Man but for a <hi>little,</hi> to a <hi>good uſe:</hi> Tell him that the <hi>Members of Chriſt</hi> are many of them very <hi>needy;</hi> and that he who <hi>gives to the Poor, lends unto the Lord;</hi> here he is ſtrongely <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>cloſe Fiſted.</hi> Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall <hi>diſcover</hi> the <hi>Maſter Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That is a Maſter Sin, unto which the <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     </gap>ſs, and an aiery frothineſs of Spirit, which is a great hinderance unto ſerious Impreſſions. In the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> Paſſion and Anger are apt to prevail, and to hurry them to revengeful words and Actions; not conſidering what injury they do to others, and how much more to themſelves. The <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick</hi> are prone to Envy, Malice, Diſcontent: The <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>tick</hi> unto Stupidity, Careleſneſs and Sloth. Now Satan takes notice of the Complexion, fails with the Stream of it, and ſuits his Bait to it; and hereby has very great advantage. Tho <hi>no ſin</hi> has the <hi>Dominion</hi> in Believers; for they <hi>are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion Sin is apt ſometimes to <hi>maſter</hi> even them alſo; therefore they had need to be watchful againſt it, and to take great care and pains to mortify it. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves his own Conſtitution, and makes conſcience of keeping under his Body that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106042:202"/> his Temperament might not be his Temptation, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. ult. I keep under my Body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt by any means, when I have Preached unto others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That is a Maſter-ſin, unto which your <hi>Callings and Conditions make you most liable.</hi> They that <hi>trade</hi> in the World, how apt are they through the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their own Hearts, to defraud and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach; to get immoderate and diſhoneſt gain: hence that ſtrict Prohibition, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 6. Let no man go beyond or defraud his Brother in any matter, knowing that the Lord is the Avenger of all ſuch, as we alſo have forewarned you, and testified.</hi> How apt are they, to venture upon the Sin of Lying and Equivocation, for advantage, and they teach and command their Servants and Children to follow their pernicious Examples; as if Earthly gain were ſo conſiderable, that 'tis no great matter how many Souls are loſt for the ſake of it. They that are <hi>Rich in this World,</hi> are prone to be <hi>high-minded, and to trust in uncertain Riches,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17. to withhold <hi>the Hire from the</hi> poor Labourers; to live in <hi>wantonneſs and pleaſure,</hi> Jam. 5. 1, 2, 3. to <hi>be full and deny God, and ſay, Who is the Lord?</hi> They that are poor in the World, are prone to <hi>Steal;</hi> (all unjuſt dealing, is Stealing, an unjuſt action makes a Man a Thief in Gods account) and <hi>to take the Name of God in vain,</hi> Prov. 30. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. That is a Maſter-ſin, which the Sinner is moſt <hi>unwilling ſhould be brought to light, and cannot bear to be reproved for.</hi> We read, <hi>Joh. 3. 20. Every one that doth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his Deeds ſhould be reproved;</hi> but of all others, he cannot endure to be reproved for the Sin that eaſily beſets him, and that he loves moſt. He <hi>tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Pearl</hi> of reproof <hi>under his Feet,</hi> and is ready
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106042:203"/> to turn again, and <hi>rend</hi> the reprover. <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt was a <hi>burning and a ſhining Light. Herod</hi> the King heard him, ſome of his Exhortaions and Doctrines went down with <hi>Herod,</hi> and produced a partial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. At length the Baptiſt comes home, and ſtrikes at the Maſter Sin, tells <hi>Herod</hi> of his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and that it was <hi>not lawful for him to have his Brothers Wife.</hi> This was not to be born, the King counted the Prophet <hi>too bold</hi> to meddle with <hi>his beloved Lust.</hi> He hears him no longer, he ſuffers him to Preach to others no longer. He firſt puts him into Priſon, and afterwards puts him to Death, and thus was this burning and ſhining Light extinguiſhed, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 17,—27.</p>
                  <p>4. The Maſter Sin, <hi>Conſcience when awakened by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, is very apt to accuſe the Sinner of, and furiouſly to fly in his face for.</hi> Conſcience though it ſleeps in a Calm, uſually awakes in a Storm; when Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threatning Affliction lies hard upon the Sinner, and he looks beyond Death unto Judgment, and into Eternity; then Conſcience ſpeaks plainly; rebukes boldly, and eſpecially the Maſter-Sin makes it very clamorous. <hi>Envy</hi> was a Sin <hi>Predominant</hi> in <hi>Joſephs Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> they could not bear the thoughts of his future advancement; they ſold him for a Slave, to prevent his being exalted over them, as was preſignified by his Dreams. Many years after, God calls for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon the Land; down go theſe Brethren into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Food, there <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſeizes them, deals hardly with them, and they are in great Diſtreſs. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience now awakes, with great terrour flies in their Faces; and their envy and cruel dealing with <hi>Joſeph</hi> their Brother, comes to remembrance with great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and trouble, <hi>Gen. 42. 21, 22. They ſaid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our Brother; in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106042:203"/> that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us and we would not hear; therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us, therefore behold alſo is his blood required.</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does Comment upon Affliction, and has its <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible gloſſes.</hi> Theſe <hi>blows</hi> are given thee for thy <hi>ſecret filthineſs,</hi> for thy <hi>intemperance,</hi> for thy <hi>injuſtice,</hi> for thy <hi>earthl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When the Soul is ready to be <hi>eſpouſed</hi> to Chriſt. <hi>This</hi> Sin ſtands up and <hi>forbids the Banes.</hi> We read of a young man in the Goſpel, ſoberly inclined; he ſaw the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternal Life and the value of it; he comes to Jeſus, and ſays, <hi>Good Master, What ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal Life?</hi> Our Lord tells him of the <hi>commands,</hi> the young man is glad of this, for as to the letter of the ſecond-Table-precepts; he had been a ſtrict obſerver of them all from his Youth up. At length our Lord, who knew <hi>Love to the World</hi> was his Maſter Sin; bids him <hi>to go and ſell all that he had on Earth,</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> him, and he ſhould have a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during and better <hi>Treaſure in Heaven.</hi> But his Love to the World hindred his Believing and Converſion, he goes away <hi>very ſorrowful, for he was very rich,</hi> Mat. 19. 21, 22.

                  <p>6. That is a Maſter Sin, which <hi>pretends most highly to conſult the Sinners ſafety, gain, and pleaſure.</hi> To be ſafe, to be advantaged, and delighted, are things very taking to Humane Nature; pretences this way are prevalent, but all Sins pretences are vain. When our Lord commands that the <hi>right eye</hi> ſhould be <hi>pluckt out,</hi> the <hi>right hand cut off;</hi> the meaning is not, that Chriſtianity binds us cruelly to diſmember our ſelves: Indeed the abuſe of our members is ſeverely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but our members themſelves are not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, but employed after an holy manner. That therefore which our Lord intends is this, either, that we ſhould be <hi>as without an eye,</hi> to behold vanity and tempting Objects; as <hi>without an hand</hi> to work that which is evil. Or, that though Sin be naturally as dear to us as our right eye; as ſeemingly neceſſary as our right hand; yet we muſt part with it, and not ſpare it to the hazard and ruine of our ſelves for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 29, 30. I might alſo add, that Sinners are apt above all to <hi>wiſh,</hi> that the Maſter Sin were <hi>no Sin</hi> at all. And becauſe the Law forbids it, they hate the Law; and the motions of their wicked Hearts towards it are more ſtrong and violent. And here is a notable difference between an <hi>unſanctified,</hi> and a <hi>ſanctified</hi> Heart. The unſanctified Heart wiſhes that the Law were <hi>leſs Holy,</hi> that <hi>Sins</hi> were <hi>no Sins;</hi> but the Heart that is ſanctified, does not deſire the Law were <hi>leſs ſtrict and pure,</hi> but that <hi>it ſelf</hi> were <hi>more pure,</hi> and more conformed unto a Law that is ſo good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; it does not deſire a Liberty to commit Sin, but that all the remaining luſtings of the Fleſh that way, were more throughly mortified.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I am to produce the <hi>Reaſons</hi> why this Maſter Sin ought <hi>eſpecially to be abandoned.</hi>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106042:204"/>
                  <p>1. Becauſe, this is <hi>Gods Principal Enemy.</hi> All Sin is againſt him, but <hi>this</hi> is a ſpecial Provocation in the the eyes of his Holineſs and Glory. The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>greateſt Grace;</hi> and Chriſt himſelf ſays, that Love is the <hi>firſt and great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> The Maſter Sin, which is moſt beloved, which takes away the affection of the Heart, which God chiefly requires; muſt needs provoke Him unto great Jealouſie.

                  <p>2. The Maſter Sin ſhould be abandon'd, becauſe in a ſpecial manner <hi>it ſeparates between God, and the Soul that is guilty of it.</hi> Sin has many bad effects, but a worſe can't be named than this, <hi>Iſa. 59. 2.

                     </hi> Oh the <hi>evil</hi> that is in Sin, which cauſes the Face of God to be <hi>hid</hi> from the Sinner! Every Sin may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a cloud; but the Sin which does moſt eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet us, is the blackeſt, the darkeſt cloud of all, which does moſt totally deprive us of the Light of Gods Countenance.</p>
                  <p>3. If the Maſter-Sin be not abandon'd, <hi>no other Sin whatſoever, can be truly repented of.</hi> A man may indeed <hi>abſtain</hi> from ſome Sins, but he does not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from them, <hi>as Sins,</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing</hi> to God; becauſe contrary to his will, and becauſe they hinder Communion with God; if he did, then certainly he would keep himſelf from the <hi>belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sin,</hi> which is principally hateful to God, and the grand obſtruction of fellowſhip with Him.</p>
                  <p>4. The Maſter Sin ſhould be abandon'd, becauſe this is <hi>ſo great a grief unto the Holy Spirit of God.</hi> How
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106042:205"/> often does he tell the falſe Profeſſour of his lying Tongue! and the unjuſt Profeſſour of his unrighteous dealing! The good Spirit vouchſafes to ſtrive with very wicked men, and moves them to hate the Sin which they unreaſonably Love to their own ruine. But if Sin be loved ſtill, the Spirit is grieved and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And is it ſafe to grieve and vex the Sanctifier, the Comforter? No. Read what follows upon vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit, <hi>Iſa. 63. 10. But they rebelled, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and he fought againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The Maſter Sin ſhould be abandon'd, becauſe 'tis <hi>this chiefly that keeps the Lord Jeſus out of the Throne.</hi> Why do ſo many ſay in their Hearts, <hi>we will not have Chriſt to Reign over us?</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe they are reſolved their <hi>fleſhly</hi> and their <hi>wordly Lusts</hi> ſhall rule there ſtill. And if Chriſt <hi>rule</hi> not, 'tis in <hi>vain</hi> to expect he will <hi>ſave,</hi> for he is the <hi>Author of Eternal Salvation unto them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. Nay, as he will <hi>not ſave</hi> them that will not be ſubject to him, ſo he has threatned to <hi>ſlay</hi> them. As <hi>for thoſe mine Enemies, that would not I ſhould reign over them, bring them forth, and ſlay them before me,</hi> Luk. 19. 27.</p>

                  <p>1. Are you willing <hi>to have this Sin, whatever it be, diſcover'd?</hi> Are you willing that God ſhould ſignifie to you, what 'tis in <hi>you</hi> that <hi>moſt of all diſpleaſes</hi> him? <hi>Job</hi> profeſſes that he <hi>cover'd not his Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Adam, by hiding his Iniquity in his Boſom,</hi> Job.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106042:205"/> 31. 33. He that <hi>hides</hi> Sin, <hi>loves</hi> it; he that pleads for Sin, is a Servant, a Slave to it.

Let not ſo much as</hi> one <hi>be ſpared, but eſpecially diſcover the</hi> Maſter-ſin, <hi>which is my greateſt Enemy, as well as thine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Are you willing to <hi>hear all the Evil the Word does ſpeak againſt the Maſter-ſin?</hi> If ſo, this would argue that 'tis no longer loved. 'Tis a Sign of malice towards our Neighbour, if we are glad to hear all the Evil that is ſpoken of him, and all the Reproach that is caſt upon him. 'Tis a Sign of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Sin, when we like to have it diſcovered, when we like that its deceitful and damnable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be repreſented, and the falſneſs, foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and filthineſs of it ſhould be laid open and naked. Sin is ſo great an Evil, that there cannot be too much Evil ſpoken of it; 'tis ſo great an Enemy, that you can never too faithfully and plainly be warned againſt it.</p>
                  <p>3. Do you apprehend your <hi>greateſt danger to be from your Maſter Sin?</hi> and therefore continually endeavour the Mortification of it? The King of <hi>Syria</hi> give this Commiſſion to his Army, <hi>Fight neither againſt ſmall nor great, ſave onely with the King of Iſrael.</hi> What? were all beſides to be ſpared? No certainly, many <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell in the battel: But there was a principal deſign to <hi>take</hi> at leaſt, if not to <hi>cut off</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael. All Sin</hi> deſerves thy hatred, <hi>no Sin</hi> is ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> an Enemy as that thou mayeſt <hi>ſafely ſpare</hi> it.

                  <p>1. Conſider, the <hi>Maſter Sin is the ſtrongeſt hold of Satan.</hi> While Sin keeps up its Dominion, Satan holds faſt his Poſſeſſion. This Sin is your moſt deadly diſeaſe, and the ſtrongeſt Cord, in which the Devil binds you and leads you Captive at his Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>2. The Maſter Sin is the <hi>great hindrance of the efficacy of the means of Grace.</hi> This makes the Preachers pains, loſt labour; this makes Mercies and Afflictions to be loſt upon you; this makes you to loſe all the duties you perform.</p>
                  <p>3. This Maſter Sin is <hi>not without its Train.</hi> A great Perſon, eſpecially a <hi>Crown'd Head,</hi> is not without a great many that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him!
